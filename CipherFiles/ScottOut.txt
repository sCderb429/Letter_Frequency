JOSEPH
CONRAD:
THE
HEART
OF
DARKNESS


























I


THE
NELLIE,
A
CRUISING
YAWL,
SWUNG
TO
HER
ANCHOR
WITHOUT
A
FLUTTER
OF
THE
SAILS,
AND
WAS
AT
REST.
THE
FLOOD
HAD
MADE,
THE
WIND
WAS
NEARLY
CALM,
AND
BEING
BOUND
DOWN
THE
RIVER,
THE
ONLY
THING
FOR
IT
WAS
TO
COME
TO
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
TURN
OF
THE
TIDE.


THE
SEA-REACH
OF
THE
THAMES
STRETCHED
BEFORE
US
LIKE
THE
BEGINNING
OF
AN
INTERMINABLE
WATERWAY.
IN
THE
OFFING
THE
SEA
AND
THE
SKY
WERE
WELDED
TOGETHER
WITHOUT
A
JOINT,
AND
IN
THE
LUMINOUS
SPACE
THE
TANNED
SAILS
OF
THE
BARGES
DRIFTING
UP
WITH
THE
TIDE
SEEMED
TO
STAND
STILL
IN
RED
CLUSTERS
OF
CANVAS
SHARPLY
PEAKED,
WITH
GLEAMS
OF
VARNISHED
SPIRITS.
A
HAZE
RESTED
ON
THE
LOW
SHORES
THAT
RAN
OUT
TO
SEA
IN
VANISHING
FLATNESS.
THE
AIR
WAS
DARK
ABOVE
GRAVESEND,
AND
FARTHER
BACK
STILL
SEEMED
CONDENSED
INTO
A
MOURNFUL
GLOOM,
BROOD-
ING
MOTIONLESS
OVER
THE
BIGGEST,
AND
THE
GREATEST,
TOWN
ON
EARTH.


THE
DIRECTOR
OF
COMPANIES
WAS
OUR
CAPTAIN
AND
OUR
HOST.
WE
FOUR
AFFECTIONATELY
WATCHED
HIS
BACK
AS
HE
STOOD
IN
THE
BOWS
LOOKING
TO
SEAWARD.
ON
THE
WHOLE
RIVER
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
THAT
LOOKED
HALF
SO
NAUTICAL.
HE
RESEMBLED
A
PILOT,
WHICH
TO
A
SEAMAN
IS
TRUST-
WORTHINESS
PERSONIFIED.
IT
WAS
DIFFICULT
TO
REALIZE
HIS
WORK
WAS
NOT
OUT
THERE
IN
THE
LUMINOUS
ESTUARY,
BUT
BEHIND
HIM,
WITHIN
THE
BROODING
GLOOM.


BETWEEN
US
THERE
WAS,
AS
I
HAVE
ALREADY
SAID
SOME-
WHERE,
THE
BOND
OF
THE
SEA.
BESIDES
HOLDING
OUR
HEARTS
TOGETHER
THROUGH
LONG
PERIODS
OF
SEPARATION,
IT
HAD
THE
EFFECT
OF
MAKING
US
TOLERANT
OF
EACH
OTHER'S
YARNS
--
AND
EVEN
CONVICTIONS.
THE
LAWYER
--
THE
BEST
OF
OLD
FELLOWS
--
HAD,
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
MANY
YEARS
AND
MANY
VIRTUES,
THE
ONLY
CUSHION
ON
DECK,
AND
WAS
LYING
ON
THE
ONLY
RUG.
THE
ACCOUNTANT
HAD
BROUGHT
OUT
ALREADY
A
BOX
OF
DOMINOES,
AND
WAS
TOYING
ARCHITECTURALLY
WITH
THE
BONES.
MARLOW
SAT
CROSS-LEGGED
RIGHT
AFT,
LEANING
AGAINST
THE
MIZZENMAST.
HE
HAD
SUNKEN
CHEEKS,
A
YELLOW
COMPLEXION,
A
STRAIGHT
BACK,
AN
ASCETIC
ASPECT,
AND,
WITH
HIS
ARMS
DROPPED,
THE
PALMS
OF
HANDS
OUT-
WARDS,
RESEMBLED
AN
IDOL.
THE
DIRECTOR,
SATISFIED
THE
ANCHOR
HAD
GOOD
HOLD,
MADE
HIS
WAY
AFT
AND
SAT
DOWN
AMONGST
US.
WE
EXCHANGED
A
FEW
WORDS
LAZILY.
AFTER-
WARDS
THERE
WAS
SILENCE
ON
BOARD
THE
YACHT.
FOR
SOME
REASON
OR
OTHER
WE
DID
NOT
BEGIN
THAT
GAME
OF
DOMI-
NOES.
WE
FELT
MEDITATIVE,
AND
FIT
FOR
NOTHING
BUT
PLACID
STARING.
THE
DAY
WAS
ENDING
IN
A
SERENITY
OF
STILL
AND
EXQUISITE
BRILLIANCE.
THE
WATER
SHONE
PACIFI-
CALLY;
THE
SKY,
WITHOUT
A
SPECK,
WAS
A
BENIGN
IMMEN-
SITY
OF
UNSTAINED
LIGHT;
THE
VERY
MIST
ON
THE
ESSEX
MARSH
WAS
LIKE
A
GAUZY
AND
RADIANT
FABRIC,
HUNG
FROM
THE
WOODED
RISES
INLAND,
AND
DRAPING
THE
LOW
SHORES
IN
DIAPHANOUS
FOLDS.
ONLY
THE
GLOOM
TO
THE
WEST,
BROODING
OVER
THE
UPPER
REACHES,
BECAME
MORE
SOMBRE
EVERY
MINUTE,
AS
IF
ANGERED
BY
THE
APPROACH
OF
THE
SUN.


AND
AT
LAST,
IN
ITS
CURVED
AND
IMPERCEPTIBLE
FALL,
THE
SUN
SANK
LOW,
AND
FROM
GLOWING
WHITE
CHANGED
TO
A
DULL
RED
WITHOUT
RAYS
AND
WITHOUT
HEAT,
AS
IF
ABOUT
TO
GO
OUT
SUDDENLY,
STRICKEN
TO
DEATH
BY
THE
TOUCH
OF
THAT
GLOOM
BROODING
OVER
A
CROWD
OF
MEN.


FORTHWITH
A
CHANGE
CAME
OVER
THE
WATERS,
AND
THE
SERENITY
BECAME
LESS
BRILLIANT
BUT
MORE
PROFOUND.
THE
OLD
RIVER
IN
ITS
BROAD
REACH
RESTED
UNRUFFLED
AT
THE
DECLINE
OF
DAY,
AFTER
AGES
OF
GOOD
SERVICE
DONE
TO
THE
RACE
THAT
PEOPLED
ITS
BANKS,
SPREAD
OUT
IN
THE
TRANQUIL
DIGNITY
OF
A
WATERWAY
LEADING
TO
THE
UTTERMOST
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH.
WE
LOOKED
AT
THE
VENERABLE
STREAM
NOT
IN
THE
VIVID
FLUSH
OF
A
SHORT
DAY
THAT
COMES
AND
DEPARTS
FOR
EVER,
BUT
IN
THE
AUGUST
LIGHT
OF
ABIDING
MEMORIES.
AND
INDEED
NOTHING
IS
EASIER
FOR
A
MAN
WHO
HAS,
AS
THE
PHRASE
GOES,
"FOLLOWED
THE
SEA"
WITH
REVERENCE
AND
AFFECTION,
THAN
TO
EVOKE
THE
GREAT
SPIRIT
OF
THE
PAST
UPON
THE
LOWER
REACHES
OF
THE
THAMES.
THE
TIDAL
CUR-
RENT
RUNS
TO
AND
FRO
IN
ITS
UNCEASING
SERVICE,
CROWDED
WITH
MEMORIES
OF
MEN
AND
SHIPS
IT
HAD
BORNE
TO
THE
REST
OF
HOME
OR
TO
THE
BATTLES
OF
THE
SEA.
IT
HAD
KNOWN
AND
SERVED
ALL
THE
MEN
OF
WHOM
THE
NATION
IS
PROUD,
FROM
SIR
FRANCIS
DRAKE
TO
SIR
JOHN
FRANKLIN,
KNIGHTS
ALL,
TITLED
AND
UNTITLED
--
THE
GREAT
KNIGHTS-ERRANT
OF
THE
SEA.
IT
HAD
BORNE
ALL
THE
SHIPS
WHOSE
NAMES
ARE
LIKE
JEWELS
FLASHING
IN
THE
NIGHT
OF
TIME,
FROM
THE
GOLDEN
HIND
RETURNING
WITH
HER
ROUND
FLANKS
FULL
OF
TREASURE,
TO
BE
VISITED
BY
THE
QUEEN'S
HIGHNESS
AND
THUS
PASS
OUT
OF
THE
GIGANTIC
TALE,
TO
THE
EREBUS
AND
TERROR,
BOUND
ON
OTHER
CONQUESTS
--
AND
THAT
NEVER
RETURNED.
IT
HAD
KNOWN
THE
SHIPS
AND
THE
MEN.
THEY
HAD
SAILED
FROM
DEPTFORD,
FROM
GREENWICH,
FROM
ERITH
--
THE
ADVENTURERS
AND
THE
SETTLERS;
KINGS'
SHIPS
AND
THE
SHIPS
OF
MEN
ON
'CHANGE;
CAPTAINS,
ADMIRALS,
THE
DARK
"INTERLOPERS"
OF
THE
EASTERN
TRADE,
AND
THE
COMMISSIONED
"GENERALS"
OF
EAST
INDIA
FLEETS.
HUNTERS
FOR
GOLD
OR
PURSUERS
OF
FAME,
THEY
ALL
HAD
GONE
OUT
ON
THAT
STREAM,
BEARING
THE
SWORD,
AND
OFTEN
THE
TORCH,
MESSENGERS
OF
THE
MIGHT
WITHIN
THE
LAND,
BEARERS
OF
A
SPARK
FROM
THE
SACRED
FIRE.
WHAT
GREATNESS
HAD
NOT
FLOATED
ON
THE
EBB
OF
THAT
RIVER
INTO
THE
MYSTERY
OF
AN
UNKNOWN
EARTH!
.
.
.
THE
DREAMS
OF
MEN,
THE
SEED
OF
COMMONWEALTHS,
THE
GERMS
OF
EMPIRES.


THE
SUN
SET;
THE
DUSK
FELL
ON
THE
STREAM,
AND
LIGHTS
BEGAN
TO
APPEAR
ALONG
THE
SHORE.
THE
CHAPMAN
LIGHT-
HOUSE,
A
THREE-LEGGED
THING
ERECT
ON
A
MUD-FLAT,
SHONE
STRONGLY.
LIGHTS
OF
SHIPS
MOVED
IN
THE
FAIRWAY
--
A
GREAT
STIR
OF
LIGHTS
GOING
UP
AND
GOING
DOWN.
AND
FARTHER
WEST
ON
THE
UPPER
REACHES
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
MONSTROUS
TOWN
WAS
STILL
MARKED
OMINOUSLY
ON
THE
SKY,
A
BROODING
GLOOM
IN
SUNSHINE,
A
LURID
GLARE
UNDER
THE
STARS.


"AND
THIS
ALSO,"
SAID
MARLOW
SUDDENLY,
"HAS
BEEN
ONE
OF
THE
DARK
PLACES
OF
THE
EARTH."


HE
WAS
THE
ONLY
MAN
OF
US
WHO
STILL
"FOLLOWED
THE
SEA."
THE
WORST
THAT
COULD
BE
SAID
OF
HIM
WAS
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
REPRESENT
HIS
CLASS.
HE
WAS
A
SEAMAN,
BUT
HE
WAS
A
WANDERER,
TOO,
WHILE
MOST
SEAMEN
LEAD,
IF
ONE
MAY
SO
EXPRESS
IT,
A
SEDENTARY
LIFE.
THEIR
MINDS
ARE
OF
THE
STAY-AT-HOME
ORDER,
AND
THEIR
HOME
IS
ALWAYS
WITH
THEM
--
THE
SHIP;
AND
SO
IS
THEIR
COUNTRY
--
THE
SEA.
ONE
SHIP
IS
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
ANOTHER,
AND
THE
SEA
IS
ALWAYS
THE
SAME.
IN
THE
IMMUTABILITY
OF
THEIR
SUR-
ROUNDINGS
THE
FOREIGN
SHORES,
THE
FOREIGN
FACES,
THE
CHANGING
IMMENSITY
OF
LIFE,
GLIDE
PAST,
VEILED
NOT
BY
A
SENSE
OF
MYSTERY
BUT
BY
A
SLIGHTLY
DISDAINFUL
IGNO-
RANCE;
FOR
THERE
IS
NOTHING
MYSTERIOUS
TO
A
SEAMAN
UNLESS
IT
BE
THE
SEA
ITSELF,
WHICH
IS
THE
MISTRESS
OF
HIS
EXISTENCE
AND
AS
INSCRUTABLE
AS
DESTINY.
FOR
THE
REST,
AFTER
HIS
HOURS
OF
WORK,
A
CASUAL
STROLL
OR
A
CASUAL
SPREE
ON
SHORE
SUFFICES
TO
UNFOLD
FOR
HIM
THE
SECRET
OF
A
WHOLE
CONTINENT,
AND
GENERALLY
HE
FINDS
THE
SECRET
NOT
WORTH
KNOWING.
THE
YARNS
OF
SEAMEN
HAVE
A
DIRECT
SIMPLICITY,
THE
WHOLE
MEANING
OF
WHICH
LIES
WITHIN
THE
SHELL
OF
A
CRACKED
NUT.
BUT
MARLOW
WAS
NOT
TYPICAL
(IF
HIS
PROPENSITY
TO
SPIN
YARNS
BE
EXCEPTED),
AND
TO
HIM
THE
MEANING
OF
AN
EPISODE
WAS
NOT
INSIDE
LIKE
A
KERNEL
BUT
OUTSIDE,
ENVELOPING
THE
TALE
WHICH
BROUGHT
IT
OUT
ONLY
AS
A
GLOW
BRINGS
OUT
A
HAZE,
IN
THE
LIKENESS
OF
ONE
OF
THESE
MISTY
HALOS
THAT
SOMETIMES
ARE
MADE
VISIBLE
BY
THE
SPECTRAL
ILLUMINATION
OF
MOONSHINE.


HIS
REMARK
DID
NOT
SEEM
AT
ALL
SURPRISING.
IT
WAS
JUST
LIKE
MARLOW.
IT
WAS
ACCEPTED
IN
SILENCE.
NO
ONE
TOOK
THE
TROUBLE
TO
GRUNT
EVEN;
AND
PRESENTLY
HE
SAID,
VERY
SLOW
--


"I
WAS
THINKING
OF
VERY
OLD
TIMES,
WHEN
THE
ROMANS
FIRST
CAME
HERE,
NINETEEN
HUNDRED
YEARS
AGO
--
THE
OTHER
DAY....
LIGHT
CAME
OUT
OF
THIS
RIVER
SINCE
--
YOU
SAY
KNIGHTS?
YES;
BUT
IT
IS
LIKE
A
RUNNING
BLAZE
ON
A
PLAIN,
LIKE
A
FLASH
OF
LIGHTNING
IN
THE
CLOUDS.
WE
LIVE
IN
THE
FLICKER
--
MAY
IT
LAST
AS
LONG
AS
THE
OLD
EARTH
KEEPS
ROLLING!
BUT
DARKNESS
WAS
HERE
YESTERDAY.
IMAGINE
THE
FEELINGS
OF
A
COMMANDER
OF
A
FINE
--
WHAT
D'YE
CALL
'EM?
--
TRIREME
IN
THE
MEDITERRANEAN,
OR-
DERED
SUDDENLY
TO
THE
NORTH
RUN
OVERLAND
ACROSS
THE
GAULS
IN
A
HURRY;
PUT
IN
CHARGE
OF
ONE
OF
THESE
CRAFT
THE
LEGIONARIES
--
A
WONDERFUL
LOT
OF
HANDY
MEN
THEY
MUST
HAVE
BEEN,
TOO
--
USED
TO
BUILD,
APPARENTLY
BY
THE
HUNDRED,
IN
A
MONTH
OR
TWO,
IF
WE
MAY
BELIEVE
WHAT
WE
READ.
IMAGINE
HIM
HERE
--
THE
VERY
END
OF
THE
WORLD,
A
SEA
THE
COLOUR
OF
LEAD,
A
SKY
THE
COLOUR
OF
SMOKE,
A
KIND
OF
SHIP
ABOUT
AS
RIGID
AS
A
CONCERTINA
--
AND
GOING
UP
THIS
RIVER
WITH
STORES,
OR
ORDERS,
OR
WHAT
YOU
LIKE.
SAND-BANKS,
MARSHES,
FORESTS,
SAVAGES,
--
PRECIOUS
LITTLE
TO
EAT
FIT
FOR
A
CIVILIZED
MAN,
NOTHING
BUT
THAMES
WATER
TO
DRINK.
NO
FALERNIAN
WINE
HERE,
NO
GOING
ASHORE.
HERE
AND
THERE
A
MILITARY
CAMP
LOST
IN
A
WILDERNESS,
LIKE
A
NEEDLE
IN
A
BUNDLE
OF
HAY
--
COLD,
FOG,
TEMPESTS,
DISEASE,
EXILE,
AND
DEATH
--
DEATH
SKULK-
ING
IN
THE
AIR,
IN
THE
WATER,
IN
THE
BUSH.
THEY
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
DYING
LIKE
FLIES
HERE.
OH,
YES
--
HE
DID
IT.
DID
IT
VERY
WELL,
TOO,
NO
DOUBT,
AND
WITHOUT
THINKING
MUCH
ABOUT
IT
EITHER,
EXCEPT
AFTERWARDS
TO
BRAG
OF
WHAT
HE
HAD
GONE
THROUGH
IN
HIS
TIME,
PERHAPS.
THEY
WERE
MEN
ENOUGH
TO
FACE
THE
DARKNESS.
AND
PERHAPS
HE
WAS
CHEERED
BY
KEEPING
HIS
EYE
ON
A
CHANCE
OF
PRO-
MOTION
TO
THE
FLEET
AT
RAVENNA
BY
AND
BY,
IF
HE
HAD
GOOD
FRIENDS
IN
ROME
AND
SURVIVED
THE
AWFUL
CLIMATE.
OR
THINK
OF
A
DECENT
YOUNG
CITIZEN
IN
A
TOGA
--
PERHAPS
TOO
MUCH
DICE,
YOU
KNOW
--
COMING
OUT
HERE
IN
THE
TRAIN
OF
SOME
PREFECT,
OR
TAX-GATHERER,
OR
TRADER
EVEN,
TO
MEND
HIS
FORTUNES.
LAND
IN
A
SWAMP,
MARCH
THROUGH
THE
WOODS,
AND
IN
SOME
INLAND
POST
FEEL
THE
SAVAGERY,
THE
UTTER
SAVAGERY,
HAD
CLOSED
ROUND
HIM
--
ALL
THAT
MYSTERIOUS
LIFE
OF
THE
WILDERNESS
THAT
STIRS
IN
THE
FOREST,
IN
THE
JUNGLES,
IN
THE
HEARTS
OF
WILD
MEN.
THERE'S
NO
INITIATION
EITHER
INTO
SUCH
MYSTERIES.
HE
HAS
TO
LIVE
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE,
WHICH
IS
ALSO
DETESTABLE.
AND
IT
HAS
A
FASCINATION,
TOO,
THAT
GOES
TO
WORK
UPON
HIM.
THE
FASCINATION
OF
THE
ABOMINATION
--
YOU
KNOW,
IMAGINE
THE
GROWING
REGRETS,
THE
LONGING
TO
ESCAPE,
THE
POWERLESS
DISGUST,
THE
SUR-
RENDER,
THE
HATE."


HE
PAUSED.


"MIND,"
HE
BEGAN
AGAIN,
LIFTING
ONE
ARM
FROM
THE
ELBOW,
THE
PALM
OF
THE
HAND
OUTWARDS,
SO
THAT,
WITH
HIS
LEGS
FOLDED
BEFORE
HIM,
HE
HAD
THE
POSE
OF
A
BUDDHA
PREACHING
IN
EUROPEAN
CLOTHES
AND
WITHOUT
A
LOTUS-FLOWER
--
"MIND,
NONE
OF
US
WOULD
FEEL
EXACTLY
LIKE
THIS.
WHAT
SAVES
US
IS
EFFICIENCY
--
THE
DEVOTION
TO
EFFICIENCY.
BUT
THESE
CHAPS
WERE
NOT
MUCH
ACCOUNT,
REALLY.
THEY
WERE
NO
COLONISTS;
THEIR
ADMINISTRATION
WAS
MERELY
A
SQUEEZE,
AND
NOTHING
MORE,
I
SUSPECT.
THEY
WERE
CONQUERORS,
AND
FOR
THAT
YOU
WANT
ONLY
BRUTE
FORCE
--
NOTHING
TO
BOAST
OF,
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
IT,
SINCE
YOUR
STRENGTH
IS
JUST
AN
ACCIDENT
ARISING
FROM
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
OTHERS.
THEY
GRABBED
WHAT
THEY
COULD
GET
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
WHAT
WAS
TO
BE
GOT.
IT
WAS
JUST
ROBBERY
WITH
VIOLENCE,
AGGRAVATED
MURDER
ON
A
GREAT
SCALE,
AND
MEN
GOING
AT
IT
BLIND
--
AS
IS
VERY
PROPER
FOR
THOSE
WHO
TACKLE
A
DARKNESS.
THE
CONQUEST
OF
THE
EARTH,
WHICH
MOSTLY
MEANS
THE
TAKING
IT
AWAY
FROM
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
COMPLEXION
OR
SLIGHTLY
FLATTER
NOSES
THAN
OURSELVES,
IS
NOT
A
PRETTY
THING
WHEN
YOU
LOOK
INTO
IT
TOO
MUCH.
WHAT
REDEEMS
IT
IS
THE
IDEA
ONLY.
AN
IDEA
AT
THE
BACK
OF
IT;
NOT
A
SENTIMENTAL
PRE-
TENCE
BUT
AN
IDEA;
AND
AN
UNSELFISH
BELIEF
IN
THE
IDEA
--
SOMETHING
YOU
CAN
SET
UP,
AND
BOW
DOWN
BEFORE,
AND
OFFER
A
SACRIFICE
TO..."


HE
BROKE
OFF.
FLAMES
GLIDED
IN
THE
RIVER,
SMALL
GREEN
FLAMES,
RED
FLAMES,
WHITE
FLAMES,
PURSUING,
OVER-
TAKING,
JOINING,
CROSSING
EACH
OTHER
--
THEN
SEPARATING
SLOWLY
OR
HASTILY.
THE
TRAFFIC
OF
THE
GREAT
CITY
WENT
ON
IN
THE
DEEPENING
NIGHT
UPON
THE
SLEEPLESS
RIVER.
WE
LOOKED
ON,
WAITING
PATIENTLY
--
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
ELSE
TO
DO
TILL
THE
END
OF
THE
FLOOD;
BUT
IT
WAS
ONLY
AFTER
A
LONG
SILENCE,
WHEN
HE
SAID,
IN
A
HESITATING
VOICE,
"I
SUPPOSE
YOU
FELLOWS
REMEMBER
I
DID
ONCE
TURN
FRESH
WATER
SAILOR
FOR
A
BIT,"
THAT
WE
KNEW
WE
WERE
FATED,
BEFORE
THE
EBB
BEGAN
TO
RUN,
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
ONE
OF
MARLOW'S
INCONCLUSIVE
EXPERIENCES.


"I
DON'T
WANT
TO
BOTHER
YOU
MUCH
WITH
WHAT
HAP-
PENED
TO
ME
PERSONALLY,"
HE
BEGAN,
SHOWING
IN
THIS
REMARK
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
MANY
TELLERS
OF
TALES
WHO
SEEM
SO
OFTEN
UNAWARE
OF
WHAT
THEIR
AUDIENCE
WOULD
BEST
LIKE
TO
HEAR;
"YET
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
EFFECT
OF
IT
ON
ME
YOU
OUGHT
TO
KNOW
HOW
I
GOT
OUT
THERE,
WHAT
I
SAW,
HOW
I
WENT
UP
THAT
RIVER
TO
THE
PLACE
WHERE
I
FIRST
MET
THE
POOR
CHAP.
IT
WAS
THE
FARTHEST
POINT
OF
NAVIGATION
AND
THE
CULMINATING
POINT
OF
MY
EXPERI-
ENCE.
IT
SEEMED
SOMEHOW
TO
THROW
A
KIND
OF
LIGHT
ON
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
ME
--
AND
INTO
MY
THOUGHTS.
IT
WAS
SOMBRE
ENOUGH,
TOO
--
AND
PITIFUL
--
NOT
EXTRAORDINARY
IN
ANY
WAY
--
NOT
VERY
CLEAR
EITHER.
NO,
NOT
VERY
CLEAR.
AND
YET
IT
SEEMED
TO
THROW
A
KIND
OF
LIGHT.


"I
HAD
THEN,
AS
YOU
REMEMBER,
JUST
RETURNED
TO
LONDON
AFTER
A
LOT
OF
INDIAN
OCEAN,
PACIFIC,
CHINA
SEAS
A
REGULAR
DOSE
OF
THE
EAST
--
SIX
YEARS
OR
SO,
AND
I
WAS
LOAFING
ABOUT,
HINDERING
YOU
FELLOWS
IN
YOUR
WORK
AND
INVADING
YOUR
HOMES,
JUST
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
GOT
A
HEAVENLY
MISSION
TO
CIVILIZE
YOU.
IT
WAS
VERY
FINE
FOR
A
TIME,
BUT
AFTER
A
BIT
I
DID
GET
TIRED
OF
RESTING.
THEN
I
BEGAN
TO
LOOK
FOR
A
SHIP
--
I
SHOULD
THINK
THE
HARDEST
WORK
ON
EARTH.
BUT
THE
SHIPS
WOULDN'T
EVEN
LOOK
AT
ME.
AND
I
GOT
TIRED
OF
THAT
GAME,
TOO.


"NOW
WHEN
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
CHAP
I
HAD
A
PASSION
FOR
MAPS.
I
WOULD
LOOK
FOR
HOURS
AT
SOUTH
AMERICA,
OR
AFRICA,
OR
AUSTRALIA,
AND
LOSE
MYSELF
IN
ALL
THE
GLORIES
OF
EXPLORATION.
AT
THAT
TIME
THERE
WERE
MANY
BLANK
SPACES
ON
THE
EARTH,
AND
WHEN
I
SAW
ONE
THAT
LOOKED
PARTICULARLY
INVITING
ON
A
MAP
(BUT
THEY
ALL
LOOK
THAT)
I
WOULD
PUT
MY
FINGER
ON
IT
AND
SAY,
'WHEN
I
GROW
UP
I
WILL
GO
THERE.'
THE
NORTH
POLE
WAS
ONE
OF
THESE
PLACES,
I
REMEMBER.
WELL,
I
HAVEN'T
BEEN
THERE
YET,
AND
SHALL
NOT
TRY
NOW.
THE
GLAMOUR'S
OFF.
OTHER
PLACES
WERE
SCATTERED
ABOUT
THE
EQUATOR,
AND
IN
EVERY
SORT
OF
LATITUDE
ALL
OVER
THE
TWO
HEMISPHERES.
I
HAVE
BEEN
IN
SOME
OF
THEM,
AND
.
.
.
WELL,
WE
WON'T
TALK
ABOUT
THAT.
BUT
THERE
WAS
ONE
YET
--
THE
BIGGEST,
THE
MOST
BLANK,
SO
TO
SPEAK
--
THAT
I
HAD
A
HANKERING
AFTER.


"TRUE,
BY
THIS
TIME
IT
WAS
NOT
A
BLANK
SPACE
ANY
MORE.
IT
HAD
GOT
FILLED
SINCE
MY
BOYHOOD
WITH
RIVERS
AND
LAKES
AND
NAMES.
IT
HAD
CEASED
TO
BE
A
BLANK
SPACE
OF
DELIGHTFUL
MYSTERY
--
A
WHITE
PATCH
FOR
A
BOY
TO
DREAM
GLORIOUSLY
OVER.
IT
HAD
BECOME
A
PLACE
OF
DARK-
NESS.
BUT
THERE
WAS
IN
IT
ONE
RIVER
ESPECIALLY,
A
MIGHTY
BIG
RIVER,
THAT
YOU
COULD
SEE
ON
THE
MAP,
RESEMBLING
AN
IMMENSE
SNAKE
UNCOILED,
WITH
ITS
HEAD
IN
THE
SEA,
ITS
BODY
AT
REST
CURVING
AFAR
OVER
A
VAST
COUNTRY,
AND
ITS
TAIL
LOST
IN
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
LAND.
AND
AS
I
LOOKED
AT
THE
MAP
OF
IT
IN
A
SHOP-WINDOW,
IT
FASCINATED
ME
AS
A
SNAKE
WOULD
A
BIRD
--
A
SILLY
LITTLE
BIRD.
THEN
I
REMEM-
BERED
THERE
WAS
A
BIG
CONCERN,
A
COMPANY
FOR
TRADE
ON
THAT
RIVER.
DASH
IT
ALL!
I
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF,
THEY
CAN'T
TRADE
WITHOUT
USING
SOME
KIND
OF
CRAFT
ON
THAT
LOT
OF
FRESH
WATER
--
STEAMBOATS!
WHY
SHOULDN'T
I
TRY
TO
GET
CHARGE
OF
ONE?
I
WENT
ON
ALONG
FLEET
STREET,
BUT
COULD
NOT
SHAKE
OFF
THE
IDEA.
THE
SNAKE
HAD
CHARMED
ME.


"YOU
UNDERSTAND
IT
WAS
A
CONTINENTAL
CONCERN,
THAT
TRADING
SOCIETY;
BUT
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
RELATIONS
LIVING
ON
THE
CONTINENT,
BECAUSE
IT'S
CHEAP
AND
NOT
SO
NASTY
AS
IT
LOOKS,
THEY
SAY.


"I
AM
SORRY
TO
OWN
I
BEGAN
TO
WORRY
THEM.
THIS
WAS
ALREADY
A
FRESH
DEPARTURE
FOR
ME.
I
WAS
NOT
USED
TO
GET
THINGS
THAT
WAY,
YOU
KNOW.
I
ALWAYS
WENT
MY
OWN
ROAD
AND
ON
MY
OWN
LEGS
WHERE
I
HAD
A
MIND
TO
GO.
I
WOULDN'T
HAVE
BELIEVED
IT
OF
MYSELF;
BUT,
THEN
--
YOU
SEE
--
I
FELT
SOMEHOW
I
MUST
GET
THERE
BY
HOOK
OR
BY
CROOK.
SO
I
WORRIED
THEM.
THE
MEN
SAID
'MY
DEAR
FELLOW,'
AND
DID
NOTHING.
THEN
--
WOULD
YOU
BELIEVE
IT?
--
I
TRIED
THE
WOMEN.
I,
CHARLIE
MARLOW,
SET
THE
WOMEN
TO
WORK
--
TO
GET
A
JOB.
HEAVENS!
WE]L,
YOU
SEE,
THE
NOTION
DROVE
ME.
I
HAD
AN
AUNT,
A
DEAR
ENTHU-
SIASTIC
SOUL.
SHE
WROTE:
'IT
WILL
BE
DELIGHTFUL.
I
AM
READY
TO
DO
ANYTHING,
ANYTHING
FOR
YOU.
IT
IS
A
GLORIOUS
IDEA.
I
KNOW
THE
WIFE
OF
A
VERY
HIGH
PERSONAGE
IN
THE
ADMINISTRATION,
AND
ALSO
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
LOTS
OF
INFLU-
ENCE
WITH,'
ETC.,
ETC.
SHE
WAS
DETERMINED
TO
MAKE
NO
END
OF
FUSS
TO
GET
ME
APPOINTED
SKIPPER
OF
A
RIVER
STEAMBOAT,
IF
SUCH
WAS
MY
FANCY.


"I
GOT
MY
APPOINTMENT
--
OF
COURSE;
AND
I
GOT
IT
VERY
QUICK.
IT
APPEARS
THE
COMPANY
HAD
RECEIVED
NEWS
THAT
ONE
OF
THEIR
CAPTAINS
HAD
BEEN
KILLED
IN
A
SCUFFLE
WITH
THE
NATIVES.
THIS
WAS
MY
CHANCE,
AND
IT
MADE
ME
THE
MORE
ANXIOUS
TO
GO.
IT
WAS
ONLY
MONTHS
AND
MONTHS
AFTERWARDS,
WHEN
I
MADE
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
RE-
COVER
WHAT
WAS
LEFT
OF
THE
BODY,
THAT
I
HEARD
THE
ORIGINAL
QUARREL
AROSE
FROM
A
MISUNDERSTANDING
ABOUT
SOME
HENS.
YES,
TWO
BLACK
HENS.
FRESLEVEN
--
THAT
WAS
THE
FELLOW'S
NAME,
A
DANE
--
THOUGHT
HIMSELF
WRONGED
SOMEHOW
IN
THE
BARGAIN,
SO
HE
WENT
ASHORE
AND
STARTED
TO
HAMMER
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
VILLAGE
WITH
A
STICK.
OH,
IT
DIDN'T
SURPRISE
ME
IN
THE
LEAST
TO
HEAR
THIS,
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
TO
BE
TOLD
THAT
FRESLEVEN
WAS
THE
GENTLEST,
QUIETEST
CREATURE
THAT
EVER
WALKED
ON
TWO
LEGS.
NO
DOUBT
HE
WAS;
BUT
HE
HAD
BEEN
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AL-
READY
OUT
THERE
ENGAGED
IN
THE
NOBLE
CAUSE,
YOU
KNOW,
AND
HE
PROBABLY
FELT
THE
NEED
AT
LAST
OF
ASSERTING
HIS
SELF-RESPECT
IN
SOME
WAY.
THEREFORE
HE
WHACKED
THE
OLD
NIGGER
MERCILESSLY,
WHILE
A
BIG
CROWD
OF
HIS
PEOPLE
WATCHED
HIM,
THUNDERSTRUCK,
TILL
SOME
MAN
--
I
WAS
TOLD
THE
CHIEF'S
SON
--
IN
DESPERATION
AT
HEARING
THE
OLD
CHAP
YELL,
MADE
A
TENTATIVE
JAB
WITH
A
SPEAR
AT
THE
WHITE
MAN
--
AND
OF
COURSE
IT
WENT
QUITE
EASY
BETWEEN
THE
SHOULDER-BLADES.
THEN
THE
WHOLE
POPULATION
CLEARED
INTO
THE
FOREST,
EXPECTING
ALL
KINDS
OF
CALAMITIES
TO
HAPPEN,
WHILE,
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND,
THE
STEAMER
FRES-
LEVEN
COMMANDED
LEFT
ALSO
IN
A
BAD
PANIC,
IN
CHARGE
OF
THE
ENGINEER,
I
BELIEVE.
AFTERWARDS
NOBODY
SEEMED
TO
TROUBLE
MUCH
ABOUT
FRESLEVEN'S
REMAINS,
TILL
I
GOT
OUT
AND
STEPPED
INTO
HIS
SHOES.
I
COULDN'T
LET
IT
REST,
THOUGH;
BUT
WHEN
AN
OPPORTUNITY
OFFERED
AT
LAST
TO
MEET
MY
PREDECESSOR,
THE
GRASS
GROWING
THROUGH
HIS
RIBS
WAS
TALL
ENOUGH
TO
HIDE
HIS
BONES.
THEY
WERE
ALL
THERE.
THE
SUPERNATURAL
BEING
HAD
NOT
BEEN
TOUCHED
AFTER
HE
FELL.
AND
THE
VILLAGE
WAS
DESERTED,
THE
HUTS
GAPED
BLACK,
ROTTING,
ALL
ASKEW
WITHIN
THE
FALLEN
EN-
DOSURES.
A
CALAMITY
HAD
COME
TO
IT,
SURE
ENOUGH.
THE
PEOPLE
HAD
VANISHED.
MAD
TERROR
HAD
SCATTERED
THEM,
MEN,
WOMEN,
AND
CHILDREN,
THROUGH
THE
BUSH,
AND
THEY
HAD
NEVER
RETURNED.
WHAT
BECAME
OF
THE
HENS
I
DON'T
KNOW
EITHER.
I
SHOULD
THINK
THE
CAUSE
OF
PROGRESS
GOT
THEM,
ANYHOW.
HOWEVER,
THROUGH
THIS
GLORIOUS
AFFAIR
I
GOT
MY
APPOINTMENT,
BEFORE
I
HAD
FAIRLY
BEGUN
TO
HOPE
FOR
IT.


"I
FLEW
AROUND
LIKE
MAD
TO
GET
READY,
AND
BEFORE
FORTY-EIGHT
HOURS
I
WAS
CROSSING
THE
CHANNEL
TO
SNOW
MYSELF
TO
MY
EMPLOYERS,
AND
SIGN
THE
CONTRACT.
IN
A
VERY
FEW
HOURS
I
ARRIVED
IN
A
CITY
THAT
ALWAYS
MAKES
ME
THINK
OF
A
WHITED
SEPULCHRE.
PREJUDICE
NO
DOUBT.
I
HAD
NO
DIFFICULTY
IN
FINDING
THE
COMPANY'S
OFFICES.
IT
WAS
THE
BIGGEST
THING
IN
THE
TOWN,
AND
EVERYBODY
I
MET
WAS
FULL
OF
IT.
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
RUN
AN
OVER
SEA
EMPIRE,
AND
MAKE
NO
END
OF
COIN
BY
TRADE.


"A
NARROW
AND
DESERTED
STREET
IN
DEEP
SHADOW,
HIGH
HOUSES,
INNUMERABLE
WINDOWS
WITH
VENETIAN
BLINDS,
A
DEAD
SILENCE,
GRASS
SPROUTING
BETWEEN
THE
STONES,
IM-
POSING
CARRIAGE
ARCHWAYS
RIGHT
AND
LEFT,
IMMENSE
DOUBLE
DOORS
STANDING
PONDEROUSLY
AJAR.
I
SLIPPED
THROUGH
ONE
OF
THESE
CRACKS,
WENT
UP
A
SWEPT
AND
UN-
GARNISHED
STAIRCASE,
AS
ARID
AS
A
DESERT,
AND
OPENED
THE
FIRST
DOOR
I
CAME
TO.
TWO
WOMEN,
ONE
FAT
AND
THE
OTHER
SLIM,
SAT
ON
STRAW-BOTTOMED
CHAIRS,
KNITTING
BLACK
WOOL.
THE
SLIM
ONE
GOT
UP
AND
WALKED
STRAIGHT
AT
ME
--
STILL
KNITTING
WITH
DOWNCAST
EYES
--
AND
ONLY
JUST
AS
I
BEGAN
TO
THINK
OF
GETTING
OUT
OF
HER
WAY,
AS
YOU
WOULD
FOR
A
SOMNAMBULIST,
STOOD
STILL,
AND
LOOKED
UP.
HER
DRESS
WAS
AS
PLAIN
AS
AN
UMBRELLA-COVER,
AND
SHE
TURNED
ROUND
WITHOUT
A
WORD
AND
PRECEDED
ME
INTO
A
WAITING-ROOM.
I
GAVE
MY
NAME,
AND
LOOKED
ABOUT.
DEAL
TABLE
IN
THE
MIDDLE,
PLAIN
CHAIRS
ALL
ROUND
THE
WALLS,
ON
ONE
END
A
LARGE
SHINING
MAP,
MARKED
WITH
ALL
THE
COLOURS
OF
A
RAINBOW.
THERE
WAS
A
VAST
AMOUNT
OF
RED
--
GOOD
TO
SEE
AT
ANY
TIME,
BECAUSE
ONE
KNOWS
THAT
SOME
REAL
WORK
IS
DONE
IN
THERE,
A
DEUCE
OF
A
LOT
OF
BLUE,
A
LITTLE
GREEN,
SMEARS
OF
ORANGE,
AND,
ON
THE
EAST
COAST,
A
PURPLE
PATCH,
TO
SHOW
WHERE
THE
JOLLY
PIONEERS
OF
PROGRESS
DRINK
THE
JOLLY
LAGER-BEER.
HOWEVER,
I
WASN'T
GOING
INTO
ANY
OF
THESE.
I
WAS
GOING
INTO
THE
YELLOW.
DEAD
IN
THE
CENTRE.
AND
THE
RIVER
WAS
THERE
--
FASCINATING
--
DEADLY
--
LIKE
A
SNAKE.
OUGH!
A
DOOR
OPENED,
A
WHITE-HAIRED
SECRETARIAL
HEAD,
BUT
WEARING
A
COMPASSIONATE
EXPRESSION,
APPEARED,
AND
A
SKINNY
FOREFINGER
BECKONED
ME
INTO
THE
SANCTUARY.
ITS
LIGHT
WAS
DIM,
AND
A
HEAVY
WRITING-DESK
SQUATTED
IN
THE
MIDDLE.
FROM
BEHIND
THAT
STRUCTURE
CAME
OUT
AN
IMPRESSION
OF
PALE
PLUMPNESS
IN
A
FROCK-COAT.
THE
GREAT
MAN
HIMSELF.
HE
WAS
FIVE
FEET
SIX,
I
SHOULD
JUDGE,
AND
HAD
HIS
GRIP
ON
THE
HANDLE-END
OF
EVER
SO
MANY
MILLIONS.
HE
SHOOK
HANDS,
I
FANCY,
MURMURED
VAGUELY,
WAS
SATISFIED
WITH
MY
FRENCH.
BON
VOYAGE.


"IN
ABOUT
FORTY-FIVE
SECONDS
I
FOUND
MYSELF
AGAIN
IN
THE
WAITING-ROOM
WITH
THE
COMPASSIONATE
SECRETARY,
WHO,
FULL
OF
DESOLATION
AND
SYMPATHY,
MADE
ME
SIGN
SOME
DOCUMENT.
I
BELIEVE
I
UNDERTOOK
AMONGST
OTHER
THINGS
NOT
TO
DISCLOSE
ANY
TRADE
SECRETS.
WELL,
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO.


"I
BEGAN
TO
FEEL
SLIGHTLY
UNEASY.
YOU
KNOW
I
AM
NOT
USED
TO
SUCH
CEREMONIES,
AND
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
OMINOUS
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE.
IT
WAS
JUST
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
BEEN
LET
INTO
SOME
CONSPIRACY
--
I
DON'T
KNOW
--
SOMETHING
NOT
QUITE
RIGHT;
AND
I
WAS
GLAD
TO
GET
OUT.
IN
THE
OUTER
ROOM
THE
TWO
WOMEN
KNITTED
BLACK
WOOL
FEVERISHLY.
PEOPLE
WERE
ARRIVING,
AND
THE
YOUNGER
ONE
WAS
WALKING
BACK
AND
FORTH
INTRODUCING
THEM.
THE
OLD
ONE
SAT
ON
HER
CHAIR.
HER
FLAT
CLOTH
SLIPPERS
WERE
PROPPED
UP
ON
A
FOOT-WARMER,
AND
A
CAT
REPOSED
ON
HER
LAP.
SHE
WORE
A
STARCHED
WHITE
AFFAIR
ON
HER
HEAD,
HAD
A
WART
ON
ONE
CHEEK,
AND
SILVER-RIMMED
SPECTACLES
HUNG
ON
THE
TIP
OF
HER
NOSE.
SHE
GLANCED
AT
ME
ABOVE
THE
GLASSES.
THE
SWIFT
AND
INDIFFERENT
PLACIDITY
OF
THAT
LOOK
TROUBLED
ME.
TWO
YOUTHS
WITH
FOOLISH
AND
CHEERY
COUNTENANCES
WERE
BEING
PILOTED
OVER,
AND
SHE
THREW
AT
THEM
THE
SAME
QUICK
GLANCE
OF
UNCONCERNED
WISDOM.
SHE
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
ALL
ABOUT
THEM
AND
ABOUT
ME,
TOO.
AN
EERIE
FEELING
CAME
OVER
ME.
SHE
SEEMED
UNCANNY
AND
FATEFUL.
OFTEN
FAR
AWAY
THERE
I
THOUGHT
OF
THESE
TWO,
GUARDING
THE
DOOR
OF
DARKNESS,
KNITTING
BLACK
WOOL
AS
FOR
A
WARM
PALL,
ONE
INTRODUCING,
INTRODUCING
CONTINUOUSLY
TO
THE
UNKNOWN,
THE
OTHER
SCRUTINIZING
THE
CHEERY
AND
FOOLISH
FACES
WITH
UNCONCERNED
OLD
EYES.
AVE!
OLD
KNITTTER
OF
BLACK
WOOL.
MORITURI
TE
SALUTANT.
NOT
MANY
OF
THOSE
SHE
LOOKED
AT
EVER
SAW
HER
AGAIN
--
NOT
HALF,
BY
A
LONG
WAY.


"THERE
WAS
YET
A
VISIT
TO
THE
DOCTOR.
'A
SIMPLE
FOR-
MALITY,'
ASSURED
ME
THE
SECRETARY,
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
TAKING
AN
IMMENSE
PART
IN
ALL
MY
SORROWS.
ACCORDINGLY
A
YOUNG
CHAP
WEARING
HIS
HAT
OVER
THE
LEFT
EYEBROW,
SOME
CLERK
I
SUPPOSE
--
THERE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
CLERKS
IN
THE
BUSINESS,
THOUGH
THE
HOUSE
WAS
AS
STILL
AS
A
HOUSE
IN
A
CITY
OF
THE
DEAD
--
CAME
FROM
SOMEWHERE
UP-STAIRS,
AND
LED
ME
FORTH.
HE
WAS
SHABBY
AND
CARE-
LESS,
WITH
INKSTAINS
ON
THE
SLEEVES
OF
HIS
JACKET,
AND
HIS
CRAVAT
WAS
LARGE
AND
BILLOWY,
UNDER
A
CHIN
SHAPED
LIKE
THE
TOE
OF
AN
OLD
BOOT.
IT
WAS
A
LITTLE
TOO
EARLY
FOR
THE
DOCTOR,
SO
I
PROPOSED
A
DRINK,
AND
THEREUPON
HE
DEVELOPED
A
VEIN
OF
JOVIALITY.
AS
WE
SAT
OVER
OUR
VER-
MOUTHS
HE
GLORIFIED
THE
COMPANY'S
BUSINESS,
AND
BY
AND
BY
I
EXPRESSED
CASUALLY
MY
SURPRISE
AT
HIM
NOT
GOING
OUT
THERE.
HE
BECAME
VERY
COOL
AND
COLLECTED
ALL
AT
ONCE.
'I
AM
NOT
SUCH
A
FOOL
AS
I
LOOK,
QUOTH
PLATO
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES,'
HE
SAID
SENTENTIOUSLY,
EMPTIED
HIS
GLASS
WITH
GREAT
RESOLUTION,
AND
WE
ROSE.


"THE
OLD
DOCTOR
FELT
MY
PULSE,
EVIDENTLY
THINKING
OF
SOMETHING
ELSE
THE
WHILE.
'GOOD,
GOOD
FOR
THERE,'
HE
MUMBLED,
AND
THEN
WITH
A
CERTAIN
EAGERNESS
ASKED
ME
WHETHER
I
WOULD
LET
HIM
MEASURE
MY
HEAD.
RATHER
SURPRISED,
I
SAID
YES,
WHEN
HE
PRODUCED
A
THING
LIKE
CALIPERS
AND
GOT
THE
DIMENSIONS
BACK
AND
FRONT
AND
EVERY
WAY,
TAKING
NOTES
CAREFULLY.
HE
WAS
AN
UN-
SHAVEN
LITTLE
MAN
IN
A
THREADBARE
COAT
LIKE
A
GABERDINE,
WITH
HIS
FEET
IN
SLIPPERS,
AND
I
THOUGHT
HIM
A
HARMLESS
FOOL.
'I
ALWAYS
ASK
LEAVE,
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
SCIENCE,
TO
MEASURE
THE
CRANIA
OF
THOSE
GOING
OUT
THERE,'
HE
SAID.
'AND
WHEN
THEY
COME
BACK,
TOO?'
I
ASKED.
'OH,
I
NEVER
SEE
THEM,'
HE
REMARKED;
'AND,
MOREOVER,
THE
CHANGES
TAKE
PLACE
INSIDE,
YOU
KNOW.'
HE
SMILED,
AS
IF
AT
SOME
QUIET
JOKE.
'SO
YOU
ARE
GOING
OUT
THERE.
FAMOUS.
INTERESTING,
TOO.'
HE
GAVE
ME
A
SEARCHING
GLANCE,
AND
MADE
ANOTHER
NOTE.
'EVER
ANY
MADNESS
IN
YOUR
FAM-
ILY?'
HE
ASKED,
IN
A
MATTER-OF-FACT
TONE.
I
FELT
VERY
ANNOYED.
'IS
THAT
QUESTION
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
SCIENCE,
TOO?'
'IT
WOULD
BE,'
HE
SAID,
WITHOUT
TAKING
NOTICE
OF
MY
IRRITATION,
'INTERESTING
FOR
SCIENCE
TO
WATCH
THE
MENTAL
CHANGES
OF
INDIVIDUALS,
ON
THE
SPOT,
BUT
.
.
.'
'ARE
YOU
AN
ALIENIST?'
I
INTERRUPTED.
'EVERY
DOCTOR
SHOULD
BE
--
A
LITTLE,'
ANSWERED
THAT
ORIGINAL,
IMPERTURB-
ABLY.
'I
HAVE
A
LITTLE
THEORY
WHICH
YOU
MESSIEURS
WHO
GO
OUT
THERE
MUST
HELP
ME
TO
PROVE.
THIS
IS
MY
SHARE
IN
THE
ADVANTAGES
MY

REAP
FROM
THE
POSSESSION
OF
SUCH
A

DEPENDENCY.

LEAVE

MY
QUESTIONS,

YOU
ARE
THE
FIRST

COMING
UNDER
MY
OBSERVATION

.'
I
HASTENED
TO
ASSURE
HIM
I
WAS
NOT
IN
THE
LEAST
TYPICAL.
'IF
I
WERE,'
SAID
I,
'I
WOULDN'T
BE
TALKING
LIKE
THIS
WITH
YOU.'
'WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
RATHER
PROFOUND,
AND
PROBABLY
ERRONEOUS,'
HE
SAID,
WITH
A
LAUGH.
'AVOID
IRRITATION
MORE
THAN
EXPOSURE
TO
THE
SUN.
ADIEU.
HOW
DO
YOU
ENGLISH
SAY,
EH?
GOOD-BYE.
AH!
GOOD-BYE.
ADIEU.
IN
THE
TROPICS
ONE
MUST
BEFORE
EVERYTHING
KEEP
CALM.'
.
.
.
HE
LIFTED
A
WARNING
FOREFINGER.
.
.
'DU
CALME,
DU
CALME,
ADIEU.'


"ONE
THING
MORE
REMAINED
TO
DO
--
SAY
GOOD-BYE
TO
MY
EXCELLENT
AUNT.
I
FOUND
HER
TRIUMPHANT.
I
HAD
A
CUP
OF
TEA
--
THE
LAST
DECENT
CUP
OF
TEA
FOR
MANY
DAYS
--
AND
IN
A
ROOM
THAT
MOST
SOOTHINGLY
LOOKED
JUST
AS
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
A
LADY'S
DRAWING-ROOM
TO
LOOK,
WE
HAD
A
LONG
QUIET
CHAT
BY
THE
FIRESIDE.
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THESE
CONFIDENCES
IT
BECAME
QUITE
PLAIN
TO
ME
I
HAD
BEEN
REPRESENTED
TO
THE
WIFE
OF
THE
HIGH
DIGNITARY,
AND
GOODNESS
KNOWS
TO
HOW
MANY
MORE
PEOPLE
BESIDES,
AS
AN
EXCEPTIONAL
AND
GIFTED
CREATURE
--
A
PIECE
OF
GOOD
FORTUNE
FOR
THE
COMPANY
--
A
MAN
YOU
DON'T
GET
HOLD
OF
EVERY
DAY.
GOOD
HEAVENS!
AND
I
WAS
GOING
TO
TAKE
CHARGE
OF
A
TWO-PENNY-HALF-PENNY
RIVER-STEAMBOAT
WITH
A
PENNY
WHISTLE
ATTACHED!
IT
APPEARED,
HOWEVER,
I
WAS
ALSO
ONE
OF
THE
WORKERS,
WITH
A
CAPITAL
--
YOU
KNOW.
SOMETHING
LIKE
AN
EMISSARY
OF
LIGHT,
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
LOWER
SORT
OF
APOSTLE.
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
LOT
OF
SUCH
ROT
LET
LOOSE
IN
PRINT
AND
TALK
JUST
ABOUT
THAT
TIME,
AND
THE
EXCELLENT
WOMAN,
LIVING
RIGHT
IN
THE
RUSH
OF
ALL
THAT
HUMBUG,
GOT
CARRIED
OFF
HER
FEET.
SHE
TALKED
ABOUT
'WEANING
THOSE
IGNORANT
MILLIONS
FROM
THEIR
HORRID
WAYS,'
TILL,
UPON
MY
WORD,
SHE
MADE
ME
QUITE
UNCOMFORTABLE.
I
VENTURED
TO
HINT
THAT
THE
COMPANY
WAS
RUN
FOR
PROFIT.


"
'YOU
FORGET,
DEAR
CHARLIE,
THAT
THE
LABOURER
IS
WORTHY
OF
HIS
HIRE,'
SHE
SAID,
BRIGHTLY.
IT'S
QUEER
HOW
OUT
OF
TOUCH
WITH
TRUTH
WOMEN
ARE.
THEY
LIVE
IN
A
WORLD
OF
THEIR
OWN,
AND
THERE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
ANYTHING
LIKE
IT,
AND
NEVER
CAN
BE.
IT
IS
TOO
BEAUTIFUL
ALTOGETHER,
AND
IF
THEY
WERE
TO
SET
IT
UP
IT
WOULD
GO
TO
PIECES
BEFORE
THE
FIRST
SUNSET.
SOME
CONFOUNDED
FACT
WE
MEN
HAVE
BEEN
LIVING
CONTENTEDLY
WITH
EVER
SINCE
THE
DAY
OF
CREATION
WOULD
START
UP
AND
KNOCK
THE
WHOLE
THING
OVER.


"AFTER
THIS
I
GOT
EMBRACED,
TOLD
TO
WEAR
FLANNEL,
BE
SURE
TO
WRITE
OFTEN,
AND
SO
ON
--
AND
I
LEFT.
IN
THE
STREET
--
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHY
--
A
QUEER
FEELING
CAME
TO
ME
THAT
I
WAS
AN
IMPOSTOR.
ODD
THING
THAT
I,
WHO
USED
TO
CLEAR
OUT
FOR
ANY
PART
OF
THE
WORLD
AT
TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS'
NOTICE,
WITH
LESS
THOUGHT
THAN
MOST
MEN
GIVE
TO
THE
CROSSING
OF
A
STREET,
HAD
A
MOMENT
--
I
WON'T
SAY
OF
HESITATION,
BUT
OF
STARTLED
PAUSE,
BEFORE
THIS
COM-
MONPLACE
AFFAIR.
THE
BEST
WAY
I
CAN
EXPLAIN
IT
TO
YOU
IS
BY
SAYING
THAT,
FOR
A
SECOND
OR
TWO,
I
FELT
AS
THOUGH,
INSTEAD
OF
GOING
TO
THE
CENTRE
OF
A
CONTINENT,
I
WERE
ABOUT
TO
SET
OFF
FOR
THE
CENTRE
OF
THE
EARTH.


"I
LEFT
IN
A
FRENCH
STEAMER,
AND
SHE
CALLED
IN
EVERY
BLAMED
PORT
THEY
HAVE
OUT
THERE,
FOR,
AS
FAR
AS
I
COULD
SEE,
THE
SOLE
PURPOSE
OF
LANDING
SOLDIERS
AND
CUSTOM-HOUSE
OFFICERS.
I
WATCHED
THE
COAST.
WATCHING
A
COAST
AS
IT
SLIPS
BY
THE
SHIP
IS
LIKE
THINKING
ABOUT
AN
ENIGMA.
THERE
IT
IS
BEFORE
YOU
--
SMILING,
FROWNING,
INVITING,
GRAND,
MEAN,
INSIPID,
OR
SAVAGE,
AND
ALWAYS
MUTE
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
WHISPERING,
'COME
AND
FIND
OUT.'
THIS
ONE
WAS
ALMOST
FEATURELESS,
AS
IF
STILL
IN
THE
MAK-
ING,
WITH
AN
ASPECT
OF
MONOTONOUS
GRIMNESS.
THE
EDGE
OF
A
COLOSSAL
JUNGLE,
SO
DARK-GREEN
AS
TO
BE
ALMOST
BLACK,
FRINGED
WITH
WHITE
SURF,
RAN
STRAIGHT,
LIKE
A
RULED
LINE,
FAR,
FAR
AWAY
ALONG
A
BLUE
SEA
WHOSE
GLITTER
WAS
BLURRED
BY
A
CREEPING
MIST.
THE
SUN
WAS
FIERCE,
THE
LAND
SEEMED
TO
GLISTEN
AND
DRIP
WITH
STEAM.
HERE
AND
THERE
GREYISH-WHITISH
SPECKS
SHOWED
UP
CLUSTERED
INSIDE
THE
WHITE
SURF,
WITH
A
FLAG
FIYING
ABOVE
THEM
PERHAPS.
SETTLEMENTS
SOME
CENTURIES
OLD,
AND
STILL
NO
BIGGER
THAN
PINHEADS
ON
THE
UNTOUCHED
EXPANSE
OF
THEIR
BACKGROUND.
WE
POUNDED
ALONG,
STOPPED,
LANDED
SOLDIERS;
WENT
ON,
LANDED
CUSTOM-HOUSE
CLERKS
TO
LEVY
TOLL
IN
WHAT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
GOD-FORSAKEN
WILDER-
NESS,
WITH
A
TIN
SHED
AND
A
FLAG-POLE
LOST
IN
IT;
LANDED
MORE
SOLDIERS
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
THE
CUSTOM-HOUSE
CLERKS,
PRESUMABLY.
SOME,
I
HEARD,
GOT
DROWNED
IN
THE
SURF;
BUT
WHETHER
THEY
DID
OR
NOT,
NOBODY
SEEMED
PARTICU-
LARLY
TO
CARE.
THEY
WERE
JUST
FLUNG
OUT
THERE,
AND
ON
WE
WENT.
EVERY
DAY
THE
COAST
LOOKED
THE
SAME,
AS
THOUGH
WE
HAD
NOT
MOVED;
BUT
WE
PASSED
VARIOUS
PLACES
--
TRADING
PLACES
WITH
NAMES
LIKE
GRAN'
BAS-
SAM,
LITTLE
POPO;
NAMES
THAT
SEEMED
TO
BELONG
TO
SOME
SORDID
FARCE
ACTED
IN
FRONT
OF
A
SINISTER
BACK-CLOTH.
THE
IDLENESS
OF
A
PASSENGER,
MY
ISOLATION
AMONGST
ALL
THESE
MEN
WITH
WHOM
I
HAD
NO
POINT
OF
CONTACT,
THE
OILY
AND
LANGUID
SEA,
THE
UNIFORM
SOMBRENESS
OF
THE
COAST,
SEEMED
TO
KEEP
ME
AWAY
FROM
THE
TRUTH
OF
THINGS,
WITHIN
THE
TOIL
OF
A
MOURNFUL
AND
SENSELESS
DELUSION.
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
SURF
HEARD
NOW
AND
THEN
WAS
A
POSI-
TIVE
PLEASURE,
LIKE
THE
SPEECH
OF
A
BROTHER.
IT
WAS
SOME-
THING
NATURAL,
THAT
HAD
ITS
REASON,
THAT
HAD
A
MEANING
NOW
AND
THEN
A
BOAT
FROM
THE
SHORE
GAVE
ONE
A
MO-
MENTARY
CONTACT
WITH
REALITY.
IT
WAS
PADDLED
BY
BLACK
FELLOWS.
YOU
COULD
SEE
FROM
AFAR
THE
WHITE
OF
THEIR
EYEBALLS
GLISTENING.
THEY
SHOUTED,
SANG;
THEIR
BODIES
STREAMED
WITH
PERSPIRATION;
THEY
HAD
FACES
LIKE
GROTESQUE
MASKS
--
THESE
CHAPS;
BUT
THEY
HAD
BONE,
MUSCLE,
A
WILD
VITALITY,
AN
INTENSE
ENERGY
OF
MOVE-
MENT,
THAT
WAS
AS
NATURAL
AND
TRUE
AS
THE
SURF
ALONG
THEIR
COAST.
THEY
WANTED
NO
EXCUSE
FOR
BEING
THERE.
THEY
WERE
A
GREAT
COMFORT
TO
LOOK
AT.
FOR
A
TIME
I
WOULD
FEEL
I
BELONGED
STILL
TO
A
WORLD
OF
STRAIGHTFOR-
WARD
FACTS;
BUT
THE
FEELING
WOULD
NOT
LAST
LONG.
SOME-
THING
WOULD
TURN
UP
TO
SCARE
IT
AWAY.
ONCE,
I
REMEM-
BER,
WE
CAME
UPON
A
MAN-OF-WAR
ANCHORED
OFF
THE
COAST.
THERE
WASN'T
EVEN
A
SHED
THERE,
AND
SHE
WAS
SHELLING
THE
BUSH.
IT
APPEARS
THE
FRENCH
HAD
ONE
OF
THEIR
WARS
GOING
ON
THEREABOUTS.
HER
ENSIGN
DROPPED
LIMP
LIKE
A
RAG;
THE
MUZZLES
OF
THE
LONG
SIX-INCH
GUNS
STUCK
OUT
ALL
OVER
THE
LOW
HULL;
THE
GREASY,
SLIMY
SWELL
SWUNG
HER
UP
LAZILY
AND
LET
HER
DOWN,
SWAYING
HER
THIN
MASTS.
IN
THE
EMPTY
IMMENSITY
OF
EARTH,
SKY,
AND
WATER,
THERE
SHE
WAS,
INCOMPREHENSIBLE,
FIRING
INTO
A
CONTINENT.
POP,
WOULD
GO
ONE
OF
THE
SIX-INCH
GUNS;
A
SMALL
FLAME
WOULD
DART
AND
VANISH,
A
LITTLE
WHITE
SMOKE
WOULD
DISAPPEAR,
A
TINY
PROJECTILE
WOULD
GIVE
A
FEEBLE
SCREECH
--
AND
NOTHING
HAPPENED.
NOTHING
COULD
HAP-
PEN.
THERE
WAS
A
TOUCH
OF
INSANITY
IN
THE
PROCEEDING,
A
SENSE
OF
LUGUBRIOUS
DROLLERY
IN
THE
SIGHT;
AND
IT
WAS
NOT
DISSIPATED
BY
SOMEBODY
ON
BOARD
ASSURING
ME
EARNESTLY
THERE
WAS
A
CAMP
OF
NATIVES
--
HE
CALLED
THEM
ENEMIES!
--
HIDDEN
OUT
OF
SIGHT
SOMEWHERE.
**

"WE
GAVE
HER
HER
LETTERS
(I
HEARD
THE
MEN
IN
THAT
LONELY
SHIP
WERE
DYING
OF
FEVER
AT
THE
RATE
OF
THREE
A
DAY)
AND
WENT
ON.
WE
CALLED
AT
SOME
MORE
PLACES
WITH
FARCICAL
NAMES,
WHERE
THE
MERRY
DANCE
OF
DEATH
AND
TRADE
GOES
ON
IN
A
STILL
AND
EARTHY
ATMOSPHERE
AS
OF
AN
OVERHEATED
CATACOMB;
ALL
ALONG
THE
FORMLESS
COAST
BORDERED
BY
DANGEROUS
SURF,
AS
IF
NATURE
HERSELF
HAD
TRIED
TO
WARD
OFF
INTRUDERS;
IN
AND
OUT
OF
RIVERS,
STREAMS
OF
DEATH
IN
LIFE,
WHOSE
BANKS
WERE
ROTTING
INTO
MUD,
WHOSE
WATERS,
THICKENED
INTO
SLIME,
INVADED
THE
CONTORTED
MANGROVES,
THAT
SEEMED
TO
WRITHE
AT
US
IN
THE
EXTREMITY
OF
AN
IMPOTENT
DESPAIR.
NOWHERE
DID
WE
STOP
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
GET
A
PARTICULARIZED
IM-
PRESSION,
BUT
THE
GENERAL
SENSE
OF
VAGUE
AND
OPPRES-
SIVE
WONDER
GREW
UPON
ME.
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
WEARY
PILGRIMAGE
AMONGST
HINTS
FOR
NIGHTMARES


"IT
WAS
UPWARD
OF
THIRTY
DAYS
BEFORE
I
SAW
THE
MOUTH
OF
THE
BIG
RIVER.
WE
ANCHORED
OFF
THE
SEAT
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT.
BUT
MY
WORK
WOULD
NOT
BEGIN
TILL
SOME
TWO
HUNDRED
MILES
FARTHER
ON.
SO
AS
SOON
AS
I
COULD
I
MADE
A
START
FOR
A
PLACE
THIRTY
MILES
HIGHER
UP.


"I
HAD
MY
PASSAGE
ON
A
LITTLE
SEA-GOING
STEAMER.
HER
CAPTAIN
WAS
A
SWEDE,
AND
KNOWING
ME
FOR
A
SEAMAN,
INVITED
ME
ON
THE
BRIDGE.
HE
WAS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
LEAN,
FAIR,
AND
MOROSE,
WITH
LANKY
HAIR
AND
A
SHUFFLING
GAIT.
AS
WE
LEFT
THE
MISERABLE
LITTLE
WHARF,
HE
TOSSED
HIS
HEAD
CONTEMPTUOUSLY
AT
THE
SHORE.
'BEEN
LIVING
THERE?'
HE
ASKED.
I
SAID,
'YES.'
'FINE
LOT
THESE
GOVERNMENT
CHAPS
--
ARE
THEY
NOT?'
HE
WENT
ON,
SPEAK-
ING
ENGLISH
WITH
GREAT
PRECISION
AND
CONSIDERABLE
BIT-
TERNESS.
'IT
IS
FUNNY
WHAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
DO
FOR
A
FEW
FRANCS
A
MONTH.
I
WONDER
WHAT
BECOMES
OF
THAT
KIND
WHEN
IT
GOES
UPCOUNTRY?'
I
SAID
TO
HIM
I
EXPECTED
TO
SEE
THAT
SOON.
'SO-O-O!'
HE
EXCLAIMED.
HE
SHUFFLED
ATHWART,
KEEPING
ONE
EYE
AHEAD
VIGILANTLY.
'DON'T
BE
TOO
SURE,'
HE
CONTINUED.
'THE
OTHER
DAY
I
TOOK
UP
A
MAN
WHO
HANGED
HIMSELF
ON
THE
ROAD.
HE
WAS
A
SWEDE,
TOO.'
'HANGED
HIMSELF!
WHY,
IN
GOD'S
NAME?'
I
CRIED.
HE
KEPT
ON
LOOKING
OUT
WATCHFULLY.
'WHO
KNOWS?
THE
SUN
TOO
MUCH
FOR
HIM,
OR
THE
COUNTRY
PERHAPS.'


"AT
LAST
WE
OPENED
A
REACH.
A
ROCKY
CLIFF
APPEARED,
MOUNDS
OF
TURNED-UP
EARTH
BY
THE
SHORE,
HOUSES
ON
A
HILL,
OTHERS
WITH
IRON
ROOFS,
AMONGST
A
WASTE
OF
EXCA-
VATIONS,
OR
HANGING
TO
THE
DECLIVITY.
A
CONTINUOUS
NOISE
OF
THE
RAPIDS
ABOVE
HOVERED
OVER
THIS
SCENE
OF
IN-
HABITED
DEVASTATION.
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE,
MOSTLY
BLACK
AND
NAKED,
MOVED
ABOUT
LIKE
ANTS.
A
JETTY
PROJECTED
INTO
THE
RIVER.
A
BLINDING
SUNLIGHT
DROWNED
ALL
THIS
AT
TIMES
IN
A
SUDDEN
RECRUDESCENCE
OF
GLARE.
'THERE'S
YOUR
COMPANY'S
STATION,'
SAID
THE
SWEDE,
POINTING
TO
THREE
WOODEN
BARRACK-LIKE
STRUCTURES
ON
THE
ROCKY
SLOPE.
'I
WILL
SEND
YOUR
THINGS
UP.
FOUR
BOXES
DID
YOU
SAY?
SO.
FAREWELL.'


"I
CAME
UPON
A
BOILER
WALLOWING
IN
THE
GRASS,
THEN
FOUND
A
PATH
LEADING
UP
THE
HILL.
IT
TURNED
ASIDE
FOR
THE
BOULDERS,
AND
ALSO
FOR
AN
UNDERSIZED
RAILWAY-TRUCK
LYING
THERE
ON
ITS
BACK
WITH
ITS
WHEELS
IN
THE
AIR.
ONE
WAS
OFF.
THE
THING
LOOKED
AS
DEAD
AS
THE
CARCASS
OF
SOME
ANIMAL.
I
CAME
UPON
MORE
PIECES
OF
DECAYING
MACHINERY,
A
STACK
OF
RUSTY
RAILS.
TO
THE
LEFT
A
CLUMP
OF
TREES
MADE
A
SHADY
SPOT,
WHERE
DARK
THINGS
SEEMED
TO
STIR
FEEBLY.
I
BLINKED,
THE
PATH
WAS
STEEP.
A
HORN
TOOTED
TO
THE
RIGHT,
AND
I
SAW
THE
BLACK
PEOPLE
RUN.
A
HEAVY
AND
DULL
DETONATION
SHOOK
THE
GROUND,
A
PUFF
OF
SMOKE
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
CLIFF,
AND
THAT
WAS
ALL.
NO
CHANGE
APPEARED
ON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
ROCK.
THEY
WERE
BUILDING
A
RAILWAY.
THE
CLIFF
WAS
NOT
IN
THE
WAY
OR
ANYTHING;
BUT
THIS
OBJECTLESS
BLASTING
WAS
ALL
THE
WORK
GOING
ON.


"A
SLIGHT
CLINKING
BEHIND
ME
MADE
ME
TURN
MY
HEAD.
SIX
BLACK
MEN
ADVANCED
IN
A
FILE,
TOILING
UP
THE
PATH.
THEY
WALKED
ERECT
AND
SLOW,
BALANCING
SMALL
BASKETS
FULL
OF
EARTH
ON
THEIR
HEADS,
AND
THE
CLINK
KEPT
TIME
WITH
THEIR
FOOTSTEPS.
BLACK
RAGS
WERE
WOUND
ROUND
THEIR
LOINS,
AND
THE
SHORT
ENDS
BEHIND
WAGGLED
TO
AND
FRO
LIKE
TAILS.
I
COULD
SEE
EVERY
RIB,
THE
JOINTS
OF
THEIR
LIMBS
WERE
LIKE
KNOTS
IN
A
ROPE;
EACH
HAD
AN
IRON
COLLAR
ON
HIS
NECK,
AND
ALL
WERE
CONNECTED
TOGETHER
WITH
A
CHAIN
WHOSE
BIGHTS
SWUNG
BETWEEN
THEM,
RHYTHMICALLY
CLINKING.
ANOTHER
REPORT
FROM
THE
CLIFF
MADE
ME
THINK
SUDDENLY
OF
THAT
SHIP
OF
WAR
I
HAD
SEEN
FIRING
INTO
A
CONTINENT.
IT
WAS
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
OMINOUS
VOICE;
BUT
THESE
MEN
COULD
BY
NO
STRETCH
OF
IMAGINATION
BE
CALLED
ENEMIES.
THEY
WERE
CALLED
CRIMINALS,
AND
THE
OUTRAGED
LAW,
LIKE
THE
BURSTING
SHELLS,
HAD
COME
TO
THEM,
AN
INSOLUBLE
MYSTERY
FROM
THE
SEA.
ALL
THEIR
MEAGRE
BREASTS
PANTED
TOGETHER,
THE
VIOLENTLY
DILATED
NOSTRILS
QUIVERED,
THE
EYES
STARED
STONILY
UPHILL.
THEY
PASSED
ME
WITHIN
SIX
INCHES,
WITH-
OUT
A
GLANCE,
WITH
THAT
COMPLETE,
DEATHLIKE
INDIFFERENCE
OF
UNHAPPY
SAVAGES.
BEHIND
THIS
RAW
MATTER
ONE
OF
THE
RECLAIMED,
THE
PRODUCT
OF
THE
NEW
FORCES
AT
WORK,
STROLLED
DESPONDENTLY,
CARRYING
A
RIFLE
BY
ITS
MIDDLE.
HE
HAD
A
UNIFORM
JACKET
WITH
ONE
BUTTON
OFF,
AND
SEEING
A
WHITE
MAN
ON
THE
PATH,
HOISTED
HIS
WEAPON
TO
HIS
SHOULDER
WITH
ALACRITY.
THIS
WAS
SIMPLE
PRUDENCE,
WHITE
MEN
BEING
SO
MUCH
ALIKE
AT
A
DISTANCE
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
TELL
WHO
I
MIGHT
BE.
HE
WAS
SPEEDILY
RE-
ASSURED,
AND
WITH
A
LARGE,
WHITE,
RASCALLY
GRIN,
AND
A
GLANCE
AT
HIS
CHARGE,
SEEMED
TO
TAKE
ME
INTO
PARTNER-
SHIP
IN
HIS
EXALTED
TRUST.
AFTER
ALL,
I
ALSO
WAS
A
PART
OF
THE
GREAT
CAUSE
OF
THESE
HIGH
AND
JUST
PROCEEDINGS.


"INSTEAD
OF
GOING
UP,
I
TURNED
AND
DESCENDED
TO
THE
LEFT.
MY
IDEA
WAS
TO
LET
THAT
CHAIN-GANG
GET
OUT
OF
SIGHT
BEFORE
I
CLIMBED
THE
HILL.
YOU
KNOW
I
AM
NOT
PARTICULARLY
TENDER;
I'VE
HAD
TO
STRIKE
AND
TO
FEND
OFF.
I'VE
HAD
TO
RESIST
AND
TO
ATTACK
SOMETIMES
--
THAT'S
ONLY
ONE
WAY
OF
RESISTING
--
WITHOUT
COUNTING
THE
EXACT
COST,
ACCORDING
TO
THE
DEMANDS
OF
SUCH
SORT
OF
LIFE
AS
I
HAD
BLUNDERED
INTO.
I'VE
SEEN
THE
DEVIL
OF
VIOLENCE,
AND
THE
DEVIL
OF
GREED,
AND
THE
DEVIL
OF
HOT
DESIRE;
BUT,
BY
ALL
THE
STARS!
THESE
WERE
STRONG,
LUSTY,
RED-EYED
DEVILS,
THAT
SWAYED
AND
DROVE
MEN
--
MEN,
I
TELL
YOU.
BUT
AS
I
STOOD
ON
THIS
HILLSIDE,
I
FORESAW
THAT
IN
THE
BLINDING
SUNSHINE
OF
THAT
LAND
I
WOULD
BECOME
AC-
QUAINTED
WITH
A
FLABBY,
PRETENDING,
WEAK-EYED
DEVIL
OF
A
RAPACIOUS
AND
PITILESS
FOLLY.
HOW
INSIDIOUS
HE
COULD
BE,
TOO,
I
WAS
ONLY
TO
FIND
OUT
SEVERAL
MONTHS
LATER
AND
A
THOUSAND
MILES
FARTHER.
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
STOOD
APPALLED,
AS
THOUGH
BY
A
WARNING.
FINALLY
I
DESCENDED
THE
HILL,
OBLIQUELY,
TOWARDS
THE
TREES
I
HAD
SEEN.


"I
AVOIDED
A
VAST
ARTIFICIAL
HOLE
SOMEBODY
HAD
BEEN
DIGGING
ON
THE
SLOPE,
THE
PURPOSE
OF
WHICH
I
FOUND
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DIVINE.
IT
WASN'T
A
QUARRY
OR
A
SANDPIT,
ANYHOW.
IT
WAS
JUST
A
HOLE.
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
CON-
NECTED
WITH
THE
PHILANTHROPIC
DESIRE
OF
GIVING
THE
CRIMINALS
SOMETHING
TO
DO.
I
DON'T
KNOW.
THEN
I
NEARLY
FELL
INTO
A
VERY
NARROW
RAVINE,
ALMOST
NO
MORE
THAN
A
SCAR
IN
THE
HILLSIDE.
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
A
LOT
OF
IMPORTED
DRAINAGE-PIPES
FOR
THE
SETTLEMENT
HAD
BEEN
TUMBLED
IN
THERE.
THERE
WASN'T
ONE
THAT
WAS
NOT
BROKEN.
IT
WAS
A
WANTON
SMASH-UP.
AT
LAST
I
GOT
UNDER
THE
TREES.
MY
PURPOSE
WAS
TO
STROLL
INTO
THE
SHADE
FOR
A
MOMENT;
BUT
NO
SOONER
WITHIN
THAN
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
I
HAD
STEPPED
INTO
THE
GLOOMY
CIRCLE
OF
SOME
INFERNO.
THE
RAPIDS
WERE
NEAR,
AND
AN
UNINTERRUPTED,
UNIFORM,
HEADLONG,
RUSHING
NOISE
FILLED
THE
MOURNFUL
STILLNESS
OF
THE
GROVE,
WHERE
NOT
A
BREATH
STIRRED,
NOT
A
LEAF
MOVED,
WITH
A
MYSTERIOUS
SOUND
--
AS
THOUGH
THE
TEAR-
ING
PACE
OF
THE
LAUNCHED
EARTH
HAD
SUDDENLY
BECOME
AUDIBLE.


"BLACK
SHAPES
CROUCHED,
LAY,
SAT
BETWEEN
THE
TREES
LEANING
AGAINST
THE
TRUNKS,
CLINGING
TO
THE
EARTH,
HALF
COMING
OUT,
HALF
EFFASED
WITHIN
THE
DIM
LIGHT,
IN
ALL
THE
ATTITUDES
OF
PAIN,
ABANDONMENT,
AND
DESPAIR.
AN-
OTHER
MINE
ON
THE
CLIFF
WENT
OFF,
FOLLOWED
BY
A
SLIGHT
SHUDDER
OF
THE
SOIL
UNDER
MY
FEET.
THE
WORK
WAS
GOING
ON.
THE
WORK!
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
PLACE
WHERE
SOME
OF
THE
HELPERS
HAD
WITHDRAWN
TO
DIE.


"THEY
WERE
DYING
SLOWLY
--
IT
WAS
VERY
CLEAR.
THEY
WERE
NOT
ENEMIES,
THEY
WERE
NOT
CRIMINALS,
THEY
WERE
NOTHING
EARTHLY
NOW
--
NOTHING
BUT
BLACK
SHADOWS
OF
DISEASE
AND
STARVATION,
LYING
CONFUSEDLY
IN
THE
GREEN-
ISH
GLOOM.
BROUGHT
FROM
ALL
THE
RECESSES
OF
THE
COAST
IN
ALL
THE
LEGALITY
OF
TIME
CONTRACTS,
LOST
IN
UNCON-
GENIAL
SURROUNDINGS,
FED
ON
UNFAMILIAR
FOOD,
THEY
SICKENED,
BECAME
INEFFICIENT,
AND
WERE
THEN
ALLOWED
TO
CRAWL
AWAY
AND
REST.
THESE
MORIBUND
SHAPES
WERE
FREE
AS
AIR
--
AND
NEARLY
AS
THIN.
I
BEGAN
TO
DISTINGUISH
THE
GLEAM
OF
THE
EYES
UNDER
THE
TREES.
THEN,
GLANCING
DOWN,
I
SAW
A
FACE
NEAR
MY
HAND.
THE
BLACK
BONES
RECLINED
AT
FULL
LENGTH
WITH
ONE
SHOULDER
AGAINST
THE
TREE,
AND
SLOWLY
THE
EYELIDS
ROSE
AND
THE
SUNKEN
EYES
LOOKED
UP
AT
ME,
ENORMOUS
AND
VACANT,
A
KIND
OF
BLIND,
WHITE
FLICKER
IN
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
ORBS,
WHICH
DIED
OUT
SLOWLY.
THE
MAN
SEEMED
YOUNG
--
ALMOST
A
BOY
--
BUT
YOU
KNOW
WITH
THEM
IT'S
HARD
TO
TELL.
I
FOUND
NOTHING
ELSE
TO
DO
BUT
TO
OFFER
HIM
ONE
OF
MY
GOOD
SWEDE'S
SHIP'S
BISCUITS
I
HAD
IN
MY
POCKET.
THE
FINGERS
CLOSED
SLOWLY
ON
IT
AND
HELD
--
THERE
WAS
NO
OTHER
MOVEMENT
AND
NO
OTHER
GLANCE.
HE
HAD
TIED
A
BIT
OF
WHITE
WORSTED
ROUND
HIS
NECK
--
WHY?
WHERE
DID
HE
GET
IT?
WAS
IT
A
BADGE
--
AN
ORNAMENT
--
CHARM
--
A
PROPITIATORY
ACT?
WAS
THERE
ANY
IDEA
AT
ALL
CON-
NECTED
WITH
IT?
IT
LOOKED
STARTLING
ROUND
HIS
BLACK
NECK,
THIS
BIT
OF
WHITE
THREAD
FROM
BEYOND
THE
SEAS.


"NEAR
THE
SAME
TREE
TWO
MORE
BUNDLES
OF
ACUTE
ANGLES
SAT
WITH
THEIR
LEGS
DRAWN
UP.
ONE,
WITH
HIS
CHIN
PROPPED
ON
HIS
KNEES,
STARED
AT
NOTHING,
IN
AN
INTOLERABLE
AND
APPALLING
MANNER:
HIS
BROTHER
PHAN-
TOM
RESTED
ITS
FOREHEAD,
AS
IF
OVERCOME
WITH
A
GREAT
WEARINESS;
AND
ALL
ABOUT
OTHERS
WERE
SCATTERED
IN
EVERY
POSE
OF
CONTORTED
COLLAPSE,
AS
IN
SOME
PICTURE
OF
A
MASSACRE
OR
A
PESTILENCE.
WHILE
I
STOOD
HORROR-
STRUCK,
ONE
OF
THESE
CREATURES
ROSE
TO
HIS
HANDS
AND
KNEES,
AND
WENT
OFF
ON
ALL-FOURS
TOWARDS
THE
RIVER
TO
DRINK.
HE
LAPPED
OUT
OF
HIS
HAND,
THEN
SAT
UP
IN
THE
SUNLIGHT,
CROSSING
HIS
SHINS
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM,
AND
AFTER
A
TIME
LET
HIS
WOOLLY
HEAD
FALL
ON
HIS
BREASTBONE.


"I
DIDN'T
WANT
ANY
MORE
LOITERING
IN
THE
SHADE,
AND
I
MADE
HASTE
TOWARDS
THE
STATION.
WHEN
NEAR
THE
BUILDINGS
I
MET
A
WHITE
MAN,
IN
SUCH
AN
UNEXPECTED
ELEGANCE
OF
GETUP
THAT
IN
THE
FIRST
MOMENT
I
TOOK
HIM
FOR
A
SORT
OF
VISION.
I
SAW
A
HIGH
STARCHED
COLLAR,
WHITE
CUFFS,
A
LIGHT
ALPACA
JACKET,
SNOWY
TROUSERS,
A
CLEAN
NECKTIE,
AND
VARNISHED
BOOTS.
NO
HAT.
HAIR
PARTED,
BRUSHED,
OILED,
UNDER
A
GREEN-LINED
PARASOL
HELD
IN
A
BIG
WHITE
HAND.
HE
WAS
AMAZING,
AND
HAD
A
PENHOLDER
BEHIND
HIS
EAR.


"I
SHOOK
HANDS
WITH
THIS
MIRACLE,
AND
I
LEARNED
HE
WAS
THE
COMPANY'S
CHIEF
ACCOUNTANT,
AND
THAT
ALL
THE
BOOKKEEPING
WAS
DONE
AT
THIS
STATION.
HE
HAD
COME
OUT
FOR
A
MOMENT,
HE
SAID,
'TO
GET
A
BREATH
OF
FRESH
AIR.'
THE
EXPRESSION
SOUNDED
WONDERFULLY
ODD,
WITH
ITS
SUGGESTION
OF
SEDENTARY
DESK-LIFE.
I
WOULDN'T
HAVE
MENTIONED
THE
FELLOW
TO
YOU
AT
ALL,
ONLY
IT
WAS
FROM
HIS
LIPS
THAT
I
FIRST
HEARD
THE
NAME
OF
THE
MAN
WHO
IS
SO
INDISSOLUBLY
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
MEMORIES
OF
THAT
TIME.
MOREOVER,
I
RESPECTED
THE
FELLOW.
YES;
I
RE-
SPECTED
HIS
COLLARS,
HIS
VAST
CUFFS,
HIS
BRUSHED
HAIR.
HIS
APPEARANCE
WAS
CERTAINLY
THAT
OF
A
HAIRDRESSER'S
DUMMY;
BUT
IN
THE
GREAT
DEMORALIZATION
OF
THE
LAND
HE
KEPT
UP
HIS
APPEARANCE.
THAT'S
BACKBONE.
HIS
STARCHED
COLLARS
AND
GOT-UP
SHIRT-FRONTS
WERE
ACHIEVE-
MENTS
OF
CHARACTER.
HE
HAD
BEEN
OUT
NEARLY
THREE
YEARS;
AND
LATER,
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
ASKING
HIM
HOW
HE
MANAGED
TO
SPORT
SUCH
LINEN.
HE
HAD
JUST
THE
FAINTEST
BLUSH,
AND
SAID
MODESTLY,
'I'VE
BEEN
TEACHING
ONE
OF
THE
NATIVE
WOMEN
ABOUT
THE
STATION.
IT
WAS
DIFFICULT.
SHE
HAD
A
DISTASTE
FOR
THE
WORK.'
THUS
THIS
MAN
HAD
VERILY
ACCOMPLISHED
SOMETHING.
AND
HE
WAS
DEVOTED
TO
HIS
BOOKS,
WHICH
WERE
IN
APPLE-PIE
ORDER.


"EVERYTHING
ELSE
IN
THE
STATION
WAS
IN
A
MUDDLE
--
HEADS,
THINGS,
BUILDINGS.
STRINGS
OF
DUSTY
NIGGERS
WITH
SPLAY
FEET
ARRIVED
AND
DEPARTED;
A
STREAM
OF
MANU-
FACTURED
GOODS,
RUBBISHY
COTTONS,
BEADS,
AND
BRASS-
WIRE
SET
INTO
THE
DEPTHS
OF
DARKNESS,
AND
IN
RETURN
CAME
A
PRECIOUS
TRICKLE
OF
IVORY.


"I
HAD
TO
WAIT
IN
THE
STATION
FOR
TEN
DAYS
--
AN
ETERNITY.
I
LIVED
IN
A
HUT
IN
THE
YARD,
BUT
TO
BE
OUT
OF
THE
CHAOS
I
WOULD
SOMETIMES
GET
INTO
THE
ACCOUNTANT'S
OFFICE.
IT
WAS
BUILT
OF
HORIZONTAL
PLANKS,
AND
SO
BADLY
PUT
TOGETHER
THAT,
AS
HE
BENT
OVER
HIS
HIGH
DESK,
HE
WAS
BARRED
FROM
NECK
TO
HEELS
WITH
NARROW
STRIPS
OF
SUNLIGHT.
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
TO
OPEN
THE
BIG
SHUTTER
TO
SEE.
IT
WAS
HOT
THERE,
TOO;
BIG
FLIES
BUZZED
FIENDISHLY,
AND
DID
NOT
STING,
BUT
STABBED.
I
SAT
GENERALLY
ON
THE
FLOOR,
WHILE,
OF
FAULTLESS
APPEARANCE
(AND
EVEN
SLIGHTLY
SCENTED),
PERCHING
ON
A
HIGH
STOOL,
HE
WROTE,
HE
WROTE.
SOMETIMES
HE
STOOD
UP
FOR
EXERCISE.
WHEN
A
TRUCKLE-
BED
WITH
A
SICK
MAN
(SOME
INVALID
AGENT
FROM
UP-
COUNTRY)
WAS
PUT
IN
THERE,
HE
EXHIBITED
A
GENTLE
AN-
NOYANCE.
'THE
GROANS
OF
THIS
SICK
PERSON,'
HE
SAID,
'DISTRACT
MY
ATTENTION.
AND
WITHOUT
THAT
IT
IS
EX-
TREMELY
DIFFICULT
TO
GUARD
AGAINST
CLERICAL
ERRORS
IN
THIS
CLIMATE.'


"ONE
DAY
HE
REMARKED,
WITHOUT
LIFTING
HIS
HEAD,
'IN
THE
INTERIOR
YOU
WILL
NO
DOUBT
MEET
MR.
KURTZ.'
ON
MY
ASKING
WHO
MR.
KURTZ
WAS,
HE
SAID
HE
WAS
A
FIRST-CLASS
AGENT;
AND
SEEING
MY
DISAPPOINTMENT
AT
THIS
INFORMATION,
HE
ADDED
SLOWLY,
LAYING
DOWN
HIS
PEN,
'HE
IS
A
VERY
REMARKABLE
PERSON.'
FURTHER
QUES-
TIONS
ELICITED
FROM
HIM
THAT
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
AT
PRESENT
IN
CHARGE
OF
A
TRADING-POST,
A
VERY
IMPORTANT
ONE,
IN
THE
TRUE
IVORY-COUNTRY,
AT
'THE
VERY
BOTTOM
OF
THERE.
SENDS
IN
AS
MUCH
IVORY
AS
ALL
THE
OTHERS
PUT
TOGETHER
.
.
.'
HE
BEGAN
TO
WRITE
AGAIN.
THE
SICK
MAN
WAS
TOO
ILL
TO
GROAN.
THE
FLIES
BUZZED
IN
A
GREAT
PEACE.


"SUDDENLY
THERE
WAS
A
GROWING
MURMUR
OF
VOICES
AND
A
GREAT
TRAMPING
OF
FEET.
A
CARAVAN
HAD
COME
IN.
A
VIOLENT
BABBLE
OF
UNCOUTH
SOUNDS
BURST
OUT
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
PLANKS.
ALL
THE
CARRIERS
WERE
SPEAKING
TOGETHER,
AND
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
UPROAR
THE
LAMENT-
ABLE
VOICE
OF
THE
CHIEF
AGENT
WAS
HEARD
'GIVING
IT
UP'
TEARFULLY
FOR
THE
TWENTIETH
TIME
THAT
DAY....
HE
ROSE
SLOWLY.
'WHAT
A
FRIGHTFUL
ROW,'
HE
SAID.
HE
CROSSED
THE
ROOM
GENTLY
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
SICK
MAN,
AND
RETURNING,
SAID
TO
ME,
'HE
DOES
NOT
HEAR.'
'WHAT!
DEAD?'
I
ASKED,
STARTLED.
'NO,
NOT
YET,'
HE
ANSWERED,
WITH
GREAT
COMPOSURE.
THEN,
ALLUDING
WITH
A
TOSS
OF
THE
HEAD
TO
THE
TUMULT
IN
THE
STATION-YARD,
'WHEN
ONE
HAS
GOT
TO
MAKE
CORRECT
ENTRIES,
ONE
COMES
TO
HATE
THOSE
SAVAGES
--
HATE
THEM
TO
THE
DEATH.'
HE
REMAINED
THOUGHTFUL
FOR
A
MOMENT.
'WHEN
YOU
SEE
MR.
KURTZ'
HE
WENT
ON,
'TELL
HIM
FROM
ME
THAT
EVERYTHING
HERE'
--
HE
GLANCED
AT
THE
DECK
--
'IS
VERY
SATISFACTORY.
I
DON'T
LIKE
TO
WRITE
TO
HIM
--
WITH
THOSE
MESSENGERS
OF
OURS
YOU
NEVER
KNOW
WHO
MAY
GET
HOLD
OF
YOUR
LETTER
--
AT
THAT
CENTRAL
STATION.'
HE
STARED
AT
ME
FOR
A
MOMENT
WITH
HIS
MILD,
BULGING
EYES.
'OHO,
HE
WILL
GO
FAR,
VERY
FAR,'
HE
BEGAN
AGAIN.
'HE
WILL
BE
A
SOMEBODY
IN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BEFORE
LONG.
THEY,
ABOVE
--
THE
COUN-
CIL
IN
EUROPE,
YOU
KNOW
--
MEAN
HIM
TO
BE.'


"HE
TURNED
TO
HIS
WORK.
THE
NOISE
OUTSIDE
HAD
CEASED,
AND
PRESENTLY
IN
GOING
OUT
I
STOPPED
AT
THE
DOOR.
IN
THE
STEADY
BUZZ
OF
FLIES
THE
HOMEWARD-BOUND
AGENT
WAS
LYING
FLUSHED
AND
INSENSIBLE;
THE
OTHER,
BENT
OVER
HIS
BOOKS,
WAS
MAKING
CORRECT
ENTRIES
OF
PERFECTLY
CORRECT
TRANSACTIONS;
AND
FIFTY
FEET
BELOW
THE
DOORSTEP
I
COULD
SEE
THE
STILL
TREETOPS
OF
THE
GROVE
OF
DEATH.


"NEXT
DAY
I
LEFT
THAT
STATION
AT
LAST,
WITH
A
CARAVAN
OF
SIXTY
MEN,
FOR
A
TWO-HUNDRED-MILE
TRAMP.


"NO
USE
TELLING
YOU
MUCH
ABOUT
THAT.
PATHS,
PATHS,
EVERYWHERE;
A
STAMPED-IN
NETWORK
OF
PATHS
SPREADING
OVER
THE
EMPTY
LAND,
THROUGH
THE
LONG
GRASS,
THROUGH
BURNT
GRASS,
THROUGH
THICKETS,
DOWN
AND
UP
CHILLY
RAVINES,
UP
AND
DOWN
STONY
HILLS

WITH

AND
A
SOLITUDE,
A
SOLITUDE,
NOBODY,
NOT
A

THE
POPULATION
HAD
CLEARED
OUT
A
LONG
TIME
AGO.
WELL,
IF
A
LOT
OF
MYSTERIOUS
NIGGERS

WITH
ALL
KINDS
OF

SUDDENLY

FANCY
EVERY

VERY
SOON.
ONLY
HERE
THE
DWELLINGS
WERE
GONE,
TOO.
STILL
I
PASSED
THROUGH
SEVERAL
ABANDONED
VILLAGES.
THERE'S
SOMETHING
PATHETICALLY
CHILDISH
IN
THE
RUINS
OF
GRASS
WALLS.
DAY
AFTER

AND
SHUFFLE
OF
SIXTY

A

AT

THE
LONG

NEAR
THE

WITH
AN
EMPTY

BY

A
GREAT

NIGHT
THE
TREMOR
OF

A
WHITE

IN
AN
UNBUTTONED

CAMPING
ON
THE
PATH
WITH
AN
ARMED
ESCORT
OF
LANK
ZANZIBARIS,
VERY
HOSPITABLE
AND
FESTIVE
--
NOT
TO
SAY

WAS
LOOKING
AFTER
THE
UPKEEP
OF
THE
ROAD,
HE
DECLARED.
CAN'T
SAY
I
SAW
ANY
ROAD
OR
ANY
UPKEEP,
UNLESS
THE
BODY
OF
A
MIDDLE-AGED
NEGRO,
WITH
A
BULLET-HOLE
IN
THE
FOREHEAD,
UPON
WHICH
I
ABSOLUTELY
STUMBLED
THREE
MILES
FARTHER
ON,
MAY
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
A
PERMANENT
IMPROVEMENT.
I
HAD
A
WHITE
COMPANION,
TOO,
NOT
A
BAD
CHAP,
BUT
RATHER
TOO
FLESHY
AND
WITH
THE
EXASPERATING
HABIT
OF
FAINTING
ON
THE
HOT
HILLSIDES,
MILES
AWAY
FROM
THE
LEAST
BIT
OF
SHADE
AND
WATER.
ANNOYING,
YOU
KNOW,
TO
HOLD
YOUR
OWN
COAT
LIKE
A
PARASOL
OVER
A
MAN'S
HEAD
WHILE
HE
IS
COMING
TO.
I
COULDN'T
HELP
ASKING
HIM
ONCE
WHAT
HE
MEANT
BY
COMING
THERE
AT
ALL.
'TO
MAKE
MONEY,
OF
COURSE.
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK?'
HE
SAID,
SCORN-
FULLY.
THEN
HE
GOT
FEVER,
AND
HAD
TO
BE
CARRIED
IN
A
HAMMOCK
SLUNG
UNDER
A
POLE.
AS
HE
WEIGHED
SIXTEEN
STONE
I
HAD
NO
END
OF
ROWS
WITH
THE
CARRIERS.
THEY
JIBBED,
RAN
AWAY,
SNEAKED
OFF
WITH
THEIR
LOADS
IN
THE
NIGHT
--
QUITE
A
MUTINY.
SO,
ONE
EVENING,
I
MADE
A
SPEECH
IN
ENGLISH
WITH
GESTURES,
NOT
ONE
OF
WHICH
WAS
LOST
TO
THE
SIXTY
PAIRS
OF
EYES
BEFORE
ME,
AND
THE
NEXT
MORNING
I
STARTED
THE
HAMMOCK
OFF
IN
FRONT
ALL
RIGHT.
AN
HOUR
AFTERWARDS
I
CAME
UPON
THE
WHOLE
CONCERN
WRECKED
IN
A
BUSH
--
MAN,
HAMMOCK,
GROANS,
BLANKETS,
HORRORS.
THE
HEAVY
POLE
HAD
SKINNED
HIS
POOR
NOSE.
HE
WAS
VERY
ANXIOUS
FOR
ME
TO
KILL
SOMEBODY,
BUT
THERE
WASN'T
THE
SHADOW
OF
A
CARRIER
NEAR.
I
REMEM-
BERED
THE
OLD
DOCTOR
--
'IT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
FOR
SCIENCE
TO
WATCH
THE
MENTAL
CHANGES
OF
INDIVIDUALS,
ON
THE
SPOT.'
I
FELT
I
WAS
BECOMING
SCIENTIFICALLY
INTEREST-
ING.
HOWEVER,
ALL
THAT
IS
TO
NO
PURPOSE.
ON
THE
FIF-
TEENTH
DAY
I
CAME
IN
SIGHT
OF
THE
BIG
RIVER
AGAIN,
AND
HOBBLED
INTO
THE
CENTRAL
STATION.
IT
WAS
ON
A
BACK
WATER
SURROUNDED
BY
SCRUB
AND
FOREST,
WITH
A
PRETTY
BORDER
OF
SMELLY
MUD
ON
ONE
SIDE,
AND
ON
THE
THREE
OTHERS
ENCLOSED
BY
A
CRAZY
FENCE
OF
RUSHES.
A
NE-
GLECTED
GAP
WAS
ALL
THE
GATE
IT
HAD,
AND
THE
FIRST
GLANCE
AT
THE
PLACE
WAS
ENOUGH
TO
LET
YOU
SEE
THE
FLABBY
DEVIL
WAS
RUNNING
THAT
SHOW.
WHITE
MEN
WITH
LONG
STAVES
IN
THEIR
HANDS
APPEARED
LANGUIDLY
FROM
AMONGST
THE
BUILDINGS,
STROLLING
UP
TO
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
ME,
AND
THEN
RETIRED
OUT
OF
SIGHT
SOMEWHERE.
ONE
OF
THEM,
A
STOUT,
EXCITABLE
CHAP
WITH
BLACK
MOUSTACHES,
INFORMED
ME
WITH
GREAT
VOLUBILITY
AND
MANY
DIGRESSIONS,
AS
SOON
AS
I
TOLD
HIM
WHO
I
WAS,
THAT
MY
STEAMER
WAS
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
RIVER.
I
WAS
THUNDERSTRUCK.
WHAT,
HOW,
WHY?
OH,
IT
WAS
'ALL
RIGHT.'
THE
'MANAGER
HIMSELF'
WAS
THERE.
ALL
QUITE
CORRECT.
'EVERYBODY
HAD
BEHAVED
SPLENDIDLY!
SPLENDIDLY!'
--
'YOU
MUST,'
HE
SAID
IN
AGI-
TATION,
'GO
AND
SEE
THE
GENERAL
MANAGER
AT
ONCE.
HE
IS
WAITING!'


"I
DID
NOT
SEE
THE
REAL
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
THAT
WRECK
AT
ONCE.
I
FANCY
I
SEE
IT
NOW,
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
NOT
AT
ALL.
CERTAINLY
THE
AFFAIR
WAS
TOO
STUPID
--
WHEN
I
THINK
OF
IT
--
TO
BE
ALTOGETHER
NATURAL.
STILL
.
.
.
BUT
AT
THE
MOMENT
IT
PRESENTED
ITSELF
SIMPLY
AS
A
CONFOUNDED
NUISANCE.
THE
STEAMER
WAS
SUNK.
THEY
HAD
STARTED
TWO
DAYS
BEFORE
IN
A
SUDDEN
HURRY
UP
THE
RIVER
WITH
THE
MANAGER
ON
BOARD,
IN
CHARGE
OF
SOME
VOLUNTEER
SKIPPER,
AND
BEFORE
THEY
HAD
BEEN
OUT
THREE
HOURS
THEY
TORE
THE
BOTTOM
OUT
OF
HER
ON
STONES,
AND
SHE
SANK
NEAR
THE
SOUTH
BANK.
I
ASKED
MYSELF
WHAT
I
WAS
TO
DO
THERE,
NOW
MY
BOAT
WAS
LOST.
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT,
I
HAD
PLENTY
TO
DO
IN
FISHING
MY
COMMAND
OUT
OF
THE
RIVER.
I
HAD
TO
SET
ABOUT
IT
THE
VERY
NEXT
DAY.
THAT,
AND
THE
REPAIRS
WHEN
I
BROUGHT
THE
PIECES
TO
THE
STA-
TION,
TOOK
SOME
MONTHS.


"MY
FIRST
INTERVIEW
WITH
THE
MANAGER
WAS
CURIOUS.
HE
DID
NOT
ASK
ME
TO
SIT
DOWN
AFTER
MY
TWENTY-MILE
WALK
THAT
MORNING.
HE
WAS
COMMONPLACE
IN
COM-
PLEXION,
IN
FEATURE,
IN
MANNERS,
AND
IN
VOICE.
HE
WAS
OF
MIDDLE
SIZE
AND
OF
ORDINARY
BUILD.
HIS
EYES,
OF
THE
USUAL
BLUE,
WERE
PERHAPS
REMARKABLY
COLD,
AND
HE
CERTAINLY
COULD
MAKE
HIS
GLANCE
FALL
ON
ONE
AS
TRENCH-
ANT
AND
HEAVY
AS
AN
AXE.
BUT
EVEN
AT
THESE
TIMES
THE
REST
OF
HIS
PERSON
SEEMED
TO
DISCLAIM
THE
INTENTION.
OTHERWISE
THERE
WAS
ONLY
AN
INDEFINABLE,
FAINT
EXPRES-
SION
OF
HIS
LIPS,
SOMETHING
STEALTHY
--
A
SMILE
--
NOT
A
SMILE
--
I
REMEMBER
IT,
BUT
I
CAN'T
EXPLAIN.
IT
WAS
UN-
CONSCIOUS,
THIS
SMILE
WAS,
THOUGH
JUST
AFTER
HE
HAD
SAID
SOMETHING
IT
GOT
INTENSIFIED
FOR
AN
INSTANT.
IT
CAME
AT
THE
END
OF
HIS
SPEECHES
LIKE
A
SEAL
APPLIED
ON
THE
WORDS
TO
MAKE
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
COMMONEST
PHRASE
APPEAR
ABSOLUTELY
INSCRUTABLE.
HE
WAS
A
COM-
MON
TRADER,
FROM
HIS
YOUTH
UP
EMPLOYED
IN
THESE
PARTS
--
NOTHING
MORE.
HE
WAS
OBEYED,
YET
HE
INSPIRED
NEITHER
LOVE
NOR
FEAR,
NOR
EVEN
RESPECT.
HE
INSPIRED
UNEASINESS.
THAT
WAS
IT!
UNEASINESS.
NOT
A
DEFINITE
MISTRUST
--
JUST
UNEASINESS
--
NOTHING
MORE.
YOU
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
EFFECTIVE
SUCH
A
.
.
.
A
.
.
.
FACULTY
CAN
BE.
HE
HAD
NO
GENIUS
FOR
ORGANIZING,
FOR
INITIATIVE,
OR
FOR
ORDER
EVEN.
THAT
WAS
EVIDENT
IN
SUCH
THINGS
AS
THE
DEPLORABLE
STATE
OF
THE
STATION.
HE
HAD
NO
LEARN-
ING,
AND
NO
INTELLIGENCE.
HIS
POSITION
HAD
COME
TO
HIM
--
WHY?
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
NEVER
ILL
.
.
.
HE
HAD
SERVED
THREE
TERMS
OF
THREE
YEARS
OUT
THERE
.
.
.
BECAUSE
TRIUMPHANT
HEALTH
IN
THE
GENERAL
ROUT
OF
CON-
STITUTIONS
IS
A
KIND
OF
POWER
IN
ITSELF.
WHEN
HE
WENT
HOME
ON
LEAVE
HE
RIOTED
ON
A
LARGE
SCALE
--
POMPOUSLY.
JACK
ASHORE
--
WITH
A
DIFFERENCE
--
IN
EXTERNALS
ONLY.
THIS
ONE
COULD
GATHER
FROM
HIS
CASUAL
TALK.
HE
ORIGI-
NATED
NOTHING,
HE
COULD
KEEP
THE
ROUTINE
GOING
--
THAT'S
ALL.
BUT
HE
WAS
GREAT.
HE
WAS
GREAT
BY
THIS
LITTLE
THING
THAT
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TELL
WHAT
COULD
CONTROL
SUCH
A
MAN.
HE
NEVER
GAVE
THAT
SECRET
AWAY.
PERHAPS
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
WITHIN
HIM.
SUCH
A
SUSPICION
MADE
ONE
PAUSE
--
FOR
OUT
THERE
THERE
WERE
NO
EXTERNAL
CHECKS.
ONCE
WHEN
VARIOUS
TROPICAL
DISEASES
HAD
LAID
LOW
ALMOST
EVERY
'AGENT'
IN
THE
STATION,
HE
WAS
HEARD
TO
SAY,
'MEN
WHO
COME
OUT
HERE
SHOULD
HAVE
NO
EN-
TRAILS.'
HE
SEALED
THE
UTTERANCE
WITH
THAT
SMILE
OF
HIS,
AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD
BEEN
A
DOOR
OPENING
INTO
A
DARKNESS
HE
HAD
IN
HIS
KEEPING.
YOU
FANCIED
YOU
HAD
SEEN
THINGS
--
BUT
THE
SEAL
WAS
ON.
WHEN
ANNOYED
AT
MEAL-
TIMES
BY
THE
CONSTANT
QUARRELS
OF
THE
WHITE
MEN
ABOUT
PRECEDENCE,
HE
ORDERED
AN
IMMENSE
ROUND
TABLE
TO
BE
MADE,
FOR
WHICH
A
SPECIAL
HOUSE
HAD
TO
BE
BUILT.
THIS
WAS
THE
STATION'S
MESS-ROOM.
WHERE
HE
SAT
WAS
THE
FIRST
PLACE
--
THE
REST
WERE
NOWHERE.
ONE
FELT
THIS
TO
BE
HIS
UNALTERABLE
CONVICTION.
HE
WAS
NEITHER
CIVIL
NOR
UNCIVIL.
HE
WAS
QUIET.
HE
ALLOWED
HIS
'BOY'
--
AN
OVER-
FED
YOUNG
NEGRO
FROM
THE
COAST
--
TO
TREAT
THE
WHITE
MEN,
UNDER
HIS
VERY
EYES,
WITH
PROVOKING
INSOLENCE.


"HE
BEGAN
TO
SPEAK
AS
SOON
AS
HE
SAW
ME.
I
HAD
BEEN
VERY
LONG
ON
THE
ROAD.
HE
COULD
NOT
WAIT.
HAD
TO
START
WITHOUT
ME.
THE
UP-RIVER
STATIONS
HAD
TO
BE
RELIEVED.
THERE
HAD
BEEN
SO
MANY
DELAYS
ALREADY
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHO
WAS
DEAD
AND
WHO
WAS
ALIVE,
AND
HOW
THEY
GOT
ON
--
AND
SO
ON,
AND
SO
ON.
HE
PAID
NO
ATTENTION
TO
MY
EXPLANATION,
AND,
PLAYING
WITH
A
STICK
OF
SEALING-WAX,
REPEATED
SEVERAL
TIMES
THAT
THE
SITUA-
TION
WAS
'VERY
GRAVE,
VERY
GRAVE.'
THERE
WERE
RU-
MOURS
THAT
A
VERY
IMPORTANT
STATION
WAS
IN
JEOPARDY,
AND
ITS
CHIEF,
MR.
KURTZ,
WAS
ILL.
HOPED
IT
WAS
NOT
TRUE.
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
.
.
.
I
FELT
WEARY
AND
IRRITABLE.
HANG
KURTZ,
I
THOUGHT.
I
INTERRUPTED
HIM
BY
SAYING
I
HAD
HEARD
OF
MR.
KURTZ
ON
THE
COAST.
'AH!
SO
THEY
TALK
OF
HIM
DOWN
THERE,'
HE
MURMURED
TO
HIMSELF.
THEN
HE
BEGAN
AGAIN,
ASSURING
ME
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
THE
BEST
AGENT
HE
HAD,
AN
EXCEPTIONAL
MAN,
OF
THE
GREATEST
IMPORTANCE
TO
THE
COMPANY;
THEREFORE
I
COULD
UNDER-
STAND
HIS
ANXIETY.
HE
WAS,
HE
SAID,
'VERY,
VERY
UNEASY.'
CERTAINLY
HE
FIDGETED
ON
HIS
CHAIR
A
GOOD
DEAL,
EX-
CLAIMED,
'AH,
MR.
KURTZ!'
BROKE
THE
STICK
OF
SEALING-
WAX
AND
SEEMED
DUMFOUNDED
BY
THE
ACCIDENT.
NEXT
THING
HE
WANTED
TO
KNOW
'HOW
LONG
IT
WOULD
TAKE
TO'
.
.
.
I
INTERRUPTED
HIM
AGAIN.
BEING
HUNGRY,
YOU
KNOW,
AND
KEPT
ON
MY
FEET
TOO,
I
WAS
GETTING
SAVAGE.
'HOW
CAN
I
TELL?'
I
SAID.
'I
HAVEN'T
EVEN
SEEN
THE
WRECK
YET
--
SOME
MONTHS,
NO
DOUBT.'
ALL
THIS
TALK
SEEMED
TO
ME
SO
FUTILE.
'SOME
MONTHS,'
HE
SAID.
"WELL,
LET
US
SAY
THREE
MONTHS
BEFORE
WE
CAN
MAKE
A
START.
YES.
THAT
OUGHT
TO
DO
THE
AFFAIR.'
I
FLUNG
OUT
OF
HIS
HUT
(HE
LIVED
ALL
ALONE
IN
A
CLAY
HUT
WITH
A
SORT
OF
VERANDAH)
MUTTERING
TO
MYSELF
MY
OPINION
OF
HIM.
HE
WAS
A
CHATTERING
IDIOT.
AFTERWARDS
I
TOOK
IT
BACK
WHEN
IT
WAS
BORNE
IN
UPON
ME
STARTLINGLY
WITH
WHAT
EXTREME
NICETY
HE
HAD
ESTIMATED
THE
TIME
REQUISITE
FOR
THE
'AFFAIR.'


"I
WENT
TO
WORK
THE
NEXT
DAY,
TURNING,
SO
TO
SPEAK,
MY
BACK
ON
THAT
STATION.
IN
THAT
WAY
ONLY
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
I
COULD
KEEP
MY
HOLD
ON
THE
REDEEMING
FACTS
OF
LIFE.
STILL,
ONE
MUST
LOOK
ABOUT
SOMETIMES;
AND
THEN
I
SAW
THIS
STATION,
THESE
MEN
STROLLING
AIMLESSLY
ABOUT
IN
THE
SUNSHINE
OF
THE
YARD.
I
ASKED
MYSELF
SOMETIMES
WHAT
IT
ALL
MEANT.
THEY
WANDERED
HERE
AND
THERE
WITH
THEIR
ABSURD
LONG
STAVES
IN
THEIR
HANDS,
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
FAITHLESS
PILGRIMS
BEWITCHED
INSIDE
A
ROTTEN
FENCE.
THE
WORD
'IVORY'
RANG
IN
THE
AIR,
WAS
WHISPERED,
WAS
SIGHED.
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THEY
WERE
PRAYING
TO
IT.
A
TAINT
OF
IMBECILE
RAPACITY
BLEW
THROUGH
IT
ALL,
LIKE
A
WHIFF
FROM
SOME
CORPSE.
BY
JOVE!
I'VE
NEVER
SEEN
ANYTHING
SO
UNREAL
IN
MY
LIFE.
AND
OUTSIDE,
THE
SILENT
WILDERNESS
SURROUNDING
THIS
CLEARED
SPECK
ON
THE
EARTH
STRUCK
ME
AS
SOMETHING
GREAT
AND
INVINCIBLE,
LIKE
EVIL
OR
TRUTH,
WAITING
PATIENTLY
FOR
THE
PASSING
AWAY
OF
THIS
FANTASTIC
INVASION.


"OH,
THESE
MONTHS!
WELL,
NEVER
MIND.
VARIOUS
THINGS
HAPPENED.
ONE
EVENING
A
GRASS
SHED
FULL
OF
CALICO,
COTTON
PRINTS,
BEADS,
AND
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT
ELSE,
BURST
INTO
A
BLAZE
SO
SUDDENLY
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
THE
EARTH
HAD
OPENED
TO
LET
AN
AVENGING
FIRE
CONSUME
ALL
THAT
TRASH.
I
WAS
SMOKING
MY
PIPE
QUIETLY
BY
MY
DISMANTLED
STEAMER,
AND
SAW
THEM
ALL
CUTTING
CAPERS
IN
THE
LIGHT,
WITH
THEIR
ARMS
LIFTED
HIGH,
WHEN
THE
STOUT
MAN
WITH
MOUSTACHES
CAME
TEARING
DOWN
TO
THE
RIVER,
A
TIN
PAIL
IN
HIS
HAND,
ASSURED
ME
THAT
EVERYBODY
WAS
'BEHAVING
SPLENDIDLY,
SPLENDIDLY,'
DIPPED
ABOUT
A
QUART
OF
WATER
AND
TORE
BACK
AGAIN.
I
NOTICED
THERE
WAS
A
HOLE
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
HIS
PAIL.


"I
STROLLED
UP.
THERE
WAS
NO
HURRY.
YOU
SEE
THE
THING
HAD
GONE
OFF
LIKE
A
BOX
OF
MATCHES.
IT
HAD
BEEN
HOPELESS
FROM
THE
VERY
FIRST.
THE
FLAME
HAD
LEAPED
HIGH,
DRIVEN
EVERYBODY
BACK,
LIGHTED
UP
EVERYTHING
--
AND
COLLAPSED.
THE
SHED
WAS
ALREADY
A
HEAP
OF
EMBERS
GLOWING
FIERCELY.
A
NIGGER
WAS
BEING
BEATEN
NEAR
BY.
THEY
SAID
HE
HAD
CAUSED
THE
FIRE
IN
SOME
WAY;
BE
THAT
AS
IT
MAY,
HE
WAS
SCREECHING
MOST
HORRIBLY.
I
SAW
HIM,
LATER,
FOR
SEVERAL
DAYS,
SITTING
IN
A
BIT
OF
SHADE
LOOKING
VERY
SICK
AND
TRYING
TO
RECOVER
HIMSELF:
AFTERWARDS
HE
AROSE
AND
WENT
OUT
--
AND
THE
WILDERNESS
WITHOUT
A
SOUND
TOOK
HIM
INTO
ITS
BOSOM
AGAIN.
AS
I
APPROACHED
THE
GLOW
FROM
THE
DARK
I
FOUND
MYSELF
AT
THE
BACK
OF
TWO
MEN,
TALKING.
I
HEARD
THE
NAME
OF
KURTZ
PRO-
NOUNCED,
THEN
THE
WORDS,
'TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THIS
UN-
FORTUNATE
ACCIDENT.'
ONE
OF
THE
MEN
WAS
THE
MANAGER.
I
WISHED
HIM
A
GOOD
EVENING.
'DID
YOU
EVER
SEE
ANYTHING
LIKE
IT
--
EH?
IT
IS
INCREDIBLE,'
HE
SAID,
AND
WALKED
OFF.
THE
OTHER
MAN
REMAINED.
HE
WAS
A
FIRST-CLASS
AGENT,
YOUNG,
GENTLEMANLY,
A
BIT
RESERVED,
WITH
A
FORKED
LITTLE
BEARD
AND
A
HOOKED
NOSE.
HE
WAS
STAND-OFFISH
WITH
THE
OTHER
AGENTS,
AND
THEY
ON
THEIR
SIDE
SAID
HE
WAS
THE
MANAGER'S
SPY
UPON
THEM.
AS
TO
ME,
I
HAD
HARDLY
EVER
SPOKEN
TO
HIM
BEFORE.
WE
GOT
INTO
TALK,
AND
BY
AND
BY
WE
STROLLED
AWAY
FROM
THE
HISSING
RUINS.
THEN
HE
ASKED
ME
TO
HIS
ROOM,
WHICH
WAS
IN
THE
MAIN
BUILDING
OF
THE
STATION.
HE
STRUCK
A
MATCH,
AND
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
THIS
YOUNG
ARISTOCRAT
HAD
NOT
ONLY
A
SILVER-MOUNTED
DRESSING-CASE
BUT
ALSO
A
WHOLE
CANDLE
ALL
TO
HIMSELF.
JUST
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
MANAGER
WAS
THE
ONLY
MAN
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
ANY
RIGHT
TO
CANDLES.
NATIVE
MATS
COVERED
THE
CLAY
WALLS;
A
COLLECTION
OF
SPEARS,
ASSEGAIS,
SHIELDS,
KNIVES
WAS
HUNG
UP
IN
TRO-
PHIES.
THE
BUSINESS
INTRUSTED
TO
THIS
FELLOW
WAS
THE
MAKING
OF
BRICKS
--
SO
I
HAD
BEEN
INFORMED;
BUT
THERE
WASN'T
A
FRAGMENT
OF
A
BRICK
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
STATION,
AND
HE
COULD
NOT
MAKE
BRICKS
WITHOUT
SOMETHING,
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT
--
STRAW
MAYBE.
ANYWAY,
IT
COULD
NOT
BE
FOUND
THERE
AND
AS
IT
WAS
NOT
LIKELY
TO
BE
SENT
FROM
EUROPE,
IT
DID
NOT
APPEAR
CLEAR
TO
ME
WHAT
HE
WAS
WAITING
FOR.
AN
ACT
OF
SPECIAL
CREATION
PERHAPS.
HOW-
EVER,
THEY
WERE
ALL
WAITING
ALL
THE
SIXTEEN
OR
TWENTY
PILGRIMS
OF
THEM
--
FOR
SOMETHING;
AND
UPON
MY
WORD
IT
DID
NOT
SEEM
AN
UNCONGENIAL
OCCUPATION,
FROM
THE
WAY
THEY
TOOK
IT,
THOUGH
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
EVER
CAME
TO
THEM
WAS
DISEASE
--
AS
FAR
AS
I
COULD
SEE.
THEY
BEGUILED
THE
TIME
BY
BACKBITING
AND
INTRIGUING
AGAINST
EACH
OTHER
IN
A
FOOLISH
KIND
OF
WAY.
THERE
WAS
AN
AIR
OF
PLOTTING
ABOUT
THAT
STATION,
BUT
NOTHING
CAME
OF
IT,
OF
COURSE.
IT
WAS
AS
UNREAL
AS
EVERYTHING
ELSE
--
AS
THE
PHILANTHROPIC
PRETENCE
OF
THE
WHOLE
CONCERN,
AS
THEIR
TALK,
AS
THEIR
GOVERNMENT,
AS
THEIR
SHOW
OF
WORK.
THE
ONLY
REAL
FEELING
WAS
A
DESIRE
TO
GET
APPOINTED
TO
A
TRADING-POST
WHERE
IVORY
WAS
TO
BE
HAD,
SO
THAT
THEY
COULD
EARN
PERCENTAGES.
THEY
INTRIGUED
AND
SLANDERED
AND
HATED
EACH
OTHER
ONLY
ON
THAT
ACCOUNT
--
BUT
AS
TO
EFFECTUALLY
LIFTING
A
LITTLE
FINGER
--
OH,
NO.
BY
HEAVENS!
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
AFTER
ALL
IN
THE
WORLD
ALLOWING
ONE
MAN
TO
STEAL
A
HORSE
WHILE
ANOTHER
MUST
NOT
LOOK
AT
A
HALTER.
STEAL
A
HORSE
STRAIGHT
OUT.
VERY
WELL.
HE
HAS
DONE
IT.
PERHAPS
HE
CAN
RIDE.
BUT
THERE
IS
A
WAY
OF
LOOKING
AT
A
HALTER
THAT
WOULD
PROVOKE
THE
MOST
CHARI-
TABLE
OF
SAINTS
INTO
A
KICK.


"I
HAD
NO
IDEA
WHY
HE
WANTED
TO
BE
SOCIABLE,
BUT
AS
WE
CHATTED
IN
THERE
IT
SUDDENLY
OCURRED
TO
ME
THE
FELLOW
WAS
TRYING
TO
GET
AT
SOMETHING
--
IN
FACT,
PUMP-
ING
ME.
HE
ALLUDED
CONSTANTLY
TO
EUROPE,
TO
THE
PEO-
PLE
I
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
KNOW
THERE
--
PUTTING
LEADING
QUESTIONS
AS
TO
MY
ACQUAINTANCES
IN
THE
SEPULCHRAL
CITY,
AND
SO
ON.
HIS
LITTLE
EYES
GLITTERED
LIKE
MICA
DISCS
--
WITH
CURIOSITY
--
THOUGH
HE
TRIED
TO
KEEP
UP
A
BIT
OF
SUPERCILIOUSNESS.
AT
FIRST
I
WAS
ASTONISHED,
BUT
VERY
SOON
I
BECAME
AWFULLY
CURIOUS
TO
SEE
WHAT
HE
WOULD
FIND
OUT
FROM
ME.
I
COULDN'T
POSSIBLY
IMAGINE
WHAT
I
HAD
IN
ME
TO
MAKE
IT
WORTH
HIS
WHILE.
IT
WAS
VERY
PRETTY
TO
SEE
HOW
HE
BAFFLED
HIMSELF,
FOR
IN
TRUTH
MY
BODY
WAS
FULL
ONLY
OF
CHILLS,
AND
MY
HEAD
HAD
NOTHING
IN
IT
BUT
THAT
WRETCHED
STEAMBOAT
BUSINESS.
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
HE
TOOK
ME
FOR
A
PERFECTLY
SHAMELESS
PREVARICATOR.
AT
LAST
HE
GOT
ANGRY,
AND,
TO
CONCEAL
A
MOVEMENT
OF
FURIOUS
ANNOYANCE,
HE
YAWNED.
I
ROSE.
THEN
I
NOTICED
A
SMALL
SKETCH
IN
OILS,
ON
A
PANEL,
REPRESENTING
A
WOMAN,
DRAPED
AND
BLINDFOLDED,
CARRYING
A
LIGHTED
TORCH.
THE
BACKGROUND
WAS
SOMBRE
--
ALMOST
BLACK.
THE
MOVE-
MENT
OF
THE
WOMAN
WAS
STATELY,
AND
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
TORCHLIGHT
ON
THE
FACE
WAS
SINISTER.


"IT
ARRESTED
ME,
AND
HE
STOOD
BY
CIVILLY,
HOLDING
AN
EMPTY
HALF-PINT
CHAMPAGNE
BOTTLE
(MEDICAL
COMFORTS)
WITH
THE
CANDLE
STUCK
IN
IT.
TO
MY
QUESTION
HE
SAID
MR.
KURTZ
HAD
PAINTED
THIS
--
IN
THIS
VERY
STATION
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
AGO
--
WHILE
WAITING
FOR
MEANS
TO
GO
TO
HIS
TRADING-POST.
'TELL
ME,
PRAY,'
SAID
I,
'WHO
IS
THIS
MR.
KURTZ?'


"
'THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
INNER
STATION,'
HE
ANSWERED
IN
A
SHORT
TONE,
LOOKING
AWAY.
'MUCH
OBLIGED,'
I
SAID,
LAUGHING.
'AND
YOU
ARE
THE
BRICKMAKER
OF
THE
CENTRAL
STATION.
EVERY
ONE
KNOWS
THAT.'
HE
WAS
SILENT
FOR
A
WHILE.
'HE
IS
A
PRODIGY,'
HE
SAID
AT
LAST.
'HE
IS
AN
EMISSARY
OF
PITY
AND
SCIENCE
AND
PROGRESS,
AND
DEVIL
KNOWS
WHAT
ELSE.
WE
WANT,'
HE
BEGAN
TO
DECLAIM
SUD-
DENLY,
'FOR
THE
GUIDANCE
OF
THE
CAUSE
INTRUSTED
TO
US
BY
EUROPE,
SO
TO
SPEAK,
HIGHER
INTELLIGENCE,
WIDE
SYMPA-
THIES,
A
SINGLENESS
OF
PURPOSE.'
'WHO
SAYS
THAT?'
I
ASKED.
'LOTS
OF
THEM,'
HE
REPLIED.
'SOME
EVEN
WRITE
THAT;
AND
SO
HE
COMES
HERE,
A
SPECIAL
BEING,
AS
YOU
OUGHT
TO
KNOW.'
'WHY
OUGHT
I
TO
KNOW?'
I
INTER-
RUPTED,
REALLY
SURPRISED.
HE
PAID
NO
ATTENTION.
'YES.
TODAY
HE
IS
CHIEF
OF
THE
BEST
STATION,
NEXT
YEAR
HE
WILL
BE
ASSISTANT-MANAGER,
TWO
YEARS
MORE
AND
.
.
.
BUT
I
DARESAY
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
HE
WILL
BE
IN
TWO
YEARS'
TIME.
YOU
ARE
OF
THE
NEW
GANG
--
THE
GANG
OF
VIRTUE.
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
WHO
SENT
HIM
SPECIALLY
ALSO
RECOM-
MENDED
YOU.
OH,
DON'T
SAY
NO.
I'VE
MY
OWN
EYES
TO
TRUST.'
LIGHT
DAWNED
UPON
ME.
MY
DEAR
AUNT'S
INFLU-
ENTIAL
ACQUAINTANCES
WERE
PRODUCING
AN
UNEXPECTED
EFFECT
UPON
THAT
YOUNG
MAN.
I
NEARLY
BURST
INTO
A
LAUGH.
'DO
YOU
READ
THE
COMPANY'S
CONFIDENTIAL
COR-
RESPONDENCE?'
I
ASKED.
HE
HADN'T
A
WORD
TO
SAY.
IT
WAS
GREAT
FUN.
'WHEN
MR.
KURTZ,'
I
CONTINUED,
SE-
VERELY,
'IS
GENERAL
MANAGER,
YOU
WON'T
HAVE
THE
OP-
PORTUNITY.'


"HE
BLEW
THE
CANDLE
OUT
SUDDENLY,
AND
WE
WENT
OUTSIDE.
THE
MOON
HAD
RISEN.
BLACK
FIGURES
STROLLED
ABOUT
LISTLESSLY,
POURING
WATER
ON
THE
GLOW,
WHENCE
PROCEEDED
A
SOUND
OF
HISSING;
STEAM
ASCENDED
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT,
THE
BEATEN
NIGGER
GROANED
SOMEWHERE.
'WHAT
A
ROW
THE
BRUTE
MAKES!'
SAID
THE
INDEFATIGABLE
MAN
WITH
THE
MOUSTACHES,
APPEARING
NEAR
US.
'SERVE
HIM
RIGHT.
TRANSGRESSION
--
PUNISHMENT
--
BANG!
PITI-
LESS,
PITILESS.
THAT'S
THE
ONLY
WAY.
THIS
WILL
PREVENT
ALL
CONFLAGRATIONS
FOR
THE
FUTURE.
I
WAS
JUST
TELLING
THE
MANAGER
.
.
.'
HE
NOTICED
MY
COMPANION,
AND
BE-
CAME
CRESTFALLEN
ALL
AT
ONCE.
'NOT
IN
BED
YET,'
HE
SAID,
WITH
A
KIND
OF
SERVILE
HEARTINESS;
'IT'S
SO
NATURAL.
HA!
DANGER
--
AGITATION.'
HE
VANISHED.
I
WENT
ON
TO
THE
RIVERSIDE,
AND
THE
OTHER
FOLLOWED
ME.
I
HEARD
A
SCATH-
ING
MURMUR
AT
MY
EAR,
'HEAP
OF
MUFFS
--
GO
TO.'
THE
PILGRIMS
COULD
BE
SEEN
IN
KNOTS
GESTICULATING,
DISCUSS-
ING.
SEVERAL
HAD
STILL
THEIR
STAVES
IN
THEIR
HANDS.
I
VERILY
BELIEVE
THEY
TOOK
THESE
STICKS
TO
BED
WITH
THEM.
BEYOND
THE
FENCE
THE
FOREST
STOOD
UP
SPECTRALLY
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT,
AND
THROUGH
THE
DIM
STIR,
THROUGH
THE
FAINT
SOUNDS
OF
THAT
LAMENTABLE
COURTYARD,
THE
SILENCE
OF
THE
LAND
WENT
HOME
TO
ONE'S
VERY
HEART
--
ITS
MYS-
TERY,
ITS
GREATNESS,
THE
AMAZING
REALITY
OF
ITS
CONCEALED
LIFE.
THE
HURT
NIGGER
MOANED
FEEBLY
SOMEWHERE
NEAR
BY,
AND
THEN
FETCHED
A
DEEP
SIGH
THAT
MADE
ME
MEND
MY
PACE
AWAY
FROM
THERE.
I
FELT
A
HAND
INTRODUCING
ITSELF
UNDER
MY
ARM.
'MY
DEAR
SIR,'
SAID
THE
FELLOW,
'I
DON'T
WANT
TO
BE
MISUNDERSTOOD,
AND
ESPECIALLY
BY
YOU,
WHO
WILL
SEE
MR.
KURTZ
LONG
BEFORE
I
CAN
HAVE
THAT
PLEASURE.
I
WOULDN'T
LIKE
HIM
TO
GET
A
FALSE
IDEA
OF
MY
DISPOSITION....'


"I
LET
HIM
RUN
ON,
THIS
PAPIER-MACHE
MEPHISTOPHE-
LES,
AND
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
IF
I
TRIED
I
COULD
POKE
MY
FOREFINGER
THROUGH
HIM,
AND
WOULD
FIND
NOTHING
INSIDE
BUT
A
LITTLE
LOOSE
DIRT,
MAYBE.
HE,
DON'T
YOU
SEE,
HAD
BEEN
PLANNING
TO
BE
ASSISTANT-MANAGER
BY
AND
BY
UNDER
THE
PRESENT
MAN,
AND
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
THE
COM-
ING
OF
THAT
KURTZ
HAD
UPSET
THEM
BOTH
NOT
A
LITTLE.
HE
TALKED
PRECIPITATELY,
AND
I
DID
NOT
TRY
TO
STOP
HIM.
I
HAD
MY
SHOULDERS
AGAINST
THE
WRECK
OF
MY
STEAMER,
HAULED
UP
ON
THE
SLOPE
LIKE
A
CARCASS
OF
SOME
BIG
RIVER
ANIMAL.
THE
SMELL
OF
MUD,
OF
PRIMEVAL
MUD,
BY
JOVE!
WAS
IN
MY
NOSTRILS,
THE
HIGH
STILLNESS
OF
PRIMEVAL
FOR-
EST
WAS
BEFORE
MY
EYES;
THERE
WERE
SHINY
PATCHES
ON
THE
BLACK
CREEK.
THE
MOON
HAD
SPREAD
OVER
EVERY-
THING
A
THIN
LAYER
OF
SILVER
--
OVER
THE
RANK
GRASS,
OVER
THE
MUD,
UPON
THE
WALL
OF
MATTED
VEGETATION
STANDING
HIGHER
THAN
THE
WALL
OF
A
TEMPLE,
OVER
THE
GREAT
RIVER
I
COULD
SEE
THROUGH
A
SOMBRE
GAP
GLITTERING,
GLITTER-
ING,
AS
IT
FLOWED
BROADLY
BY
WITHOUT
A
MURMUR.
ALL
THIS
WAS
GREAT,
EXPECTANT,
MUTE,
WHILE
THE
MAN
JAB-
BERED
ABOUT
HIMSELF.
I
WONDERED
WHETHER
THE
STILLNESS
ON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
IMMENSITY
LOOKING
AT
US
TWO
WERE
MEANT
AS
AN
APPEAL
OR
AS
A
MENACE.
WHAT
WERE
WE
WHO
HAD
STRAYED
IN
HERE?
COULD
WE
HANDLE
THAT
DUMB
THING,
OR
WOULD
IT
HANDLE
US?
I
FELT
HOW
BIG,
HOW
CONFOUNDEDLY
BIG,
WAS
THAT
THING
THAT
COULDN'T
TALK,
AND
PERHAPS
WAS
DEAF
AS
WELL.
WHAT
WAS
IN
THERE?
I
COULD
SEE
A
LITTLE
IVORY
COMING
OUT
FROM
THERE,
AND
I
HAD
HEARD
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
IN
THERE.
I
HAD
HEARD
ENOUGH
ABOUT
IT,
TOO
--
GOD
KNOWS!
YET
SOMEHOW
IT
DIDN'T
BRING
ANY
IMAGE
WITH
IT
--
NO
MORE
THAN
IF
I
HAD
BEEN
TOLD
AN
ANGEL
OR
A
FIEND
WAS
IN
THERE.
I
BELIEVED
IT
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
ONE
OF
YOU
MIGHT
BELIEVE
THERE
ARE
INHABITANTS
IN
THE
PLANET
MARS.
I
KNEW
ONCE
A
SCOTCH
SAILMAKER
WHO
WAS
CERTAIN,
DEAD
SURE,
THERE
WERE
PEO-
PLE
IN
MARS.
IF
YOU
ASKED
HIM
FOR
SOME
IDEA
HOW
THEY
LOOKED
AND
BEHAVED,
HE
WOULD
GET
SHY
AND
MUTTER
SOMETHING
ABOUT
'WALKING
ON
ALL-FOURS.'
IF
YOU
AS
MUCH
AS
SMILED,
HE
WOULD
--
THOUGH
A
MAN
OF
SIXTY
--
OFFER
TO
FIGHT
YOU.
I
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
GONE
SO
FAR
AS
TO
FIGHT
FOR
KURTZ,
BUT
I
WENT
FOR
HIM
NEAR
ENOUGH
TO
LIE.
YOU
KNOW
I
HATE,
DETEST,
AND
CAN'T
BEAR
A
LIE,
NOT
BECAUSE
I
AM
STRAIGHTER
THAN
THE
REST
OF
US,
BUT
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
APPALLS
ME.
THERE
IS
A
TAINT
OF
DEATH,
A
FLAVOUR
OF
MORTALITY
IN
LIES
WHICH
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
HATE
AND
DETEST
IN
THE
WORLD
--
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
FORGET.
IT
MAKES
ME
MISERABLE
AND
SICK,
LIKE
BITING
SOMETHING
ROTTEN
WOULD
DO.
TEMPERAMENT,
I
SUPPOSE.
WELL,
I
WENT
NEAR
ENOUGH
TO
IT
BY
LETTING
THE
YOUNG
FOOL
THERE
BELIEVE
ANYTHING
HE
LIKED
TO
IMAGINE
AS
TO
MY
INFLU-
ENCE
IN
EUROPE.
I
BECAME
IN
AN
INSTANT
AS
MUCH
OF
A
PRETENCE
AS
THE
REST
OF
THE
BEWITCHED
PILGRIMS.
THIS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
HAD
A
NOTION
IT
SOMEHOW
WOULD
BE
OF
HELP
TO
THAT
KURTZ
WHOM
AT
THE
TIME
I
DID
NOT
SEE
YOU
UNDERSTAND.
HE
WAS
JUST
A
WORD
FOR
ME.
I
DID
NOT
SEE
THE
MAN
IN
THE
NAME
ANY
MORE
THAN
YOU
DO.
DO
YOU
SEE
HIM?
DO
YOU
SEE
THE
STORY?
DO
YOU
SEE
ANYTHING?
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
I
AM
TRYING
TO
TELL
YOU
A
DREAM
--
MAKING
A
VAIN
ATTEMPT,
BECAUSE
NO
RELATION
OF
A
DREAM
CAN
CONVEY
THE
DREAM-SENSATION,
THAT
COM-
MINGLING
OF
ABSURDITY,
SURPRISE,
AND
BEWILDERMENT
IN
A
TREMOR
OF
STRUGGLING
REVOLT,
THAT
NOTION
OF
BEING
CAPTURED
BY
THE
INCREDIBLE
WHICH
IS
OF
THE
VERY
ESSENCE
OF
DREAMS...."


HE
WAS
SILENT
FOR
A
WHILE.


".
.
.
NO,
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE;
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
CON-
VEY
THE
LIFE-SENSATION
OF
ANY
GIVEN
EPOCH
OF
ONE'S
EX-
ISTENCE
--
THAT
WHICH
MAKES
ITS
TRUTH,
ITS
MEANING
ITS
SUBTLE
AND
PENETRATING
ESSENCE.
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE.
WE
LIVE,
AS
WE
DREAM
ALONE...."


HE
PAUSED
AGAIN
AGAIN
IF
REFLECTING,
THEN
ADDED:


"OF
COURSE
IN
THIS
YOU
FELLOWS
SEE
MORE
THAN
I
COULD
THEN.
YOU
SEE
ME,
WHOM
YOU
KNOW.
.
.
."


IT
HAD
BECOME
SO
PITCH
DARK
THAT
WE
LISTENERS
COULD
HARDLY
SEE
ONE
ANOTHER.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
ALREADY
HE,
SITTING
APART,
HAD
BEEN
NO
MORE
TO
US
THAN
A
VOICE.
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
WORD
FROM
ANYBODY.
THE
OTHERS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
ASLEEP,
BUT
I
WAS
AWAKE.
I
LISTENED,
I
LISTENED
ON
THE
WATCH
FOR
THE
SENTENCE,
FOR
THE
WORD,
THAT
WOULD
GIVE
ME
THE
CLUE
TO
THE
FAINT
UNEASI-
NESS
INSPIRED
BY
THIS
NARRATIVE
THAT
SEEMED
TO
SHAPE
ITSELF
WITHOUT
HUMAN
LIPS
IN
THE
HEAVY
NIGHT-AIR
OF
THE
RIVER.


".
.
.
YES
--
I
LET
HIM
RUN
ON,"
MARLOW
BEGAN
AGAIN,
"AND
THINK
WHAT
HE
PLEASED
ABOUT
THE
POWERS
THAT
WERE
BEHIND
ME.
I
DID!
AND
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
BEHIND
ME!
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
BUT
THAT
WRETCHED,
OLD,
MANGLED
STEAMBOAT
I
WAS
LEANING
AGAINST,
WHILE
HE
TALKED
FLUENTLY
ABOUT
'THE
NECESSITY
FOR
EVERY
MAN
TO
GET
ON.'
'AND
WHEN
ONE
COMES
OUT
HERE,
YOU
CON-
CEIVE,
IT
IS
NOT
TO
GAZE
AT
THE
MOON.'
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
A
'UNIVERSAL
GENIUS,'
BUT
EVEN
A
GENIUS
WOULD
FIND
IT
EASIER
TO
WORK
WITH
'ADEQUATE
TOOLS
--
INTELLIGENT
MEN.'
HE
DID
NOT
MAKE
BRICKS
--
WHY,
THERE
WAS
A
PHYSICAL
IMPOSSIBILITY
IN
THE
WAY
--
AS
I
WAS
WELL
AWARE;
AND
IF
HE
DID
SECRETARIAL
WORK
FOR
THE
MANAGER,
IT
WAS
BE-
CAUSE
'NO
SENSIBLE
MAN
REJECTS
WANTONLY
THE
CONFIDENCE
OF
HIS
SUPERIORS.'
DID
I
SEE
IT?
I
SAW
IT.
WHAT
MORE
DID
I
WANT?
WHAT
I
REALLY
WANTED
WAS
RIVETS,
BY
HEAVEN!
RIVETS.
TO
GET
ON
WITH
THE
WORK
--
TO
STOP
THE
HOLE.
RIVETS
I
WANTED.
THERE
WERE
CASES
OF
THEM
DOWN
AT
THE
COAST
CASES
PILED
UP
--
BURST
--
SPLIT!
YOU
KICKED
A
LOOSE
RIVET
AT
EVERY
SECOND
STEP
IN
THAT
STATION-YARD
ON
THE
HILLSIDE.
RIVETS
HAD
ROLLED
INTO
THE
GROVE
OF
DEATH.
YOU
COULD
FILL
YOUR
POCKETS
WITH
RIVETS
FOR
THE
TROUBLE
OF
STOOPING
DOWN
--
AND
THERE
WASN'T
ONE
RIVET
TO
BE
FOUND
WHERE
IT
WAS
WANTED.
WE
HAD
PLATES
THAT
WOULD
TO,
BUT
NOTHING
TO
FASTEN
THEM
WITH.
AND
EVERY
WEEK
THE
MESSENGER,
A
LONE
NEGRO,
LETTERBAG
ON
SHOUL-
DER
AND
STAFF
IN
HAND,
LEFT
OUR
STATION
FOR
THE
COAST.
AND
SEVERAL
TIMES
A
WEEK
A
COAST
CARAVAN
CAME
IN
WITH
TRADE
GOODS
--
GHASTLY
GLAZED
CALICO
THAT
MADE
YOU
SHUDDER
ONLY
TO
LOOK
AT
IT,
GLASS
BEADS
VALUE
ABOUT
A
PENNY
A
QUART,
CONFOUNDED
SPOTTED
COTTON
HANDKER-
CHIEFS.
AND
NO
RIVETS.
THREE
CARRIERS
COULD
HAVE
BROUGHT
ALL
THAT
WAS
WANTED
TO
SET
THAT
STEAMBOAT
AFLOAT.


"HE
WAS
BECOMING
CONFIDENTIAL
NOW,
BUT
I
FANCY
MY
UNRESPONSIVE
ATTITUDE
MUST
HAVE
EXASPERATED
HIM
AT
LAST,
FOR
HE
JUDGED
IT
NECESSARY
TO
INFORM
ME
HE
FEARED
NEITHER
GOD
NOR
DEVIL,
LET
ALONE
ANY
MERE
MAN.
I
SAID
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
VERY
WELL,
BUT
WHAT
I
WANTED
WAS
A
CERTAIN
QUANTITY
OF
RIVETS
--
AND
RIVETS
WERE
WHAT
REALLY
MR.
KURTZ
WANTED,
IF
HE
HAD
ONLY
KNOWN
IT.
NOW
LETTERS
WENT
TO
THE
COAST
EVERY
WEEK....
'MY
DEAR
SIR,'
HE
CRIED,
'I
WRITE
FROM
DICTATION.'
I
DEMANDED
RIVETS.
THERE
WAS
A
WAY
--
FOR
AN
INTELLIGENT
MAN.
HE
CHANGED
HIS
MANNER;
BECAME
VERY
COLD,
AND
SUDDENLY
BEGAN
TO
TALK
ABOUT
A
HIPPOPOTAMUS;
WONDERED
WHETHER
SLEEPING
ON
BOARD
THE
STEAMER
(I
STUCK
TO
MY
SALVAGE
NIGHT
AND
DAY)
I
WASN'T
DISTURBED.
THERE
WAS
AN
OLD
HIPPO
THAT
HAD
THE
BAD
HABIT
OF
GETTING
OUT
ON
THE
BANK
AND
ROAMING
AT
NIGHT
OVER
THE
STATION
GROUNDS.
THE
PILGRIMS
USED
TO
TURN
OUT
IN
A
BODY
AND
EMPTY
EVERY
RIFLE
THEY
COULD
LAY
HANDS
ON
AT
HIM.
SOME
EVEN
HAD
SAT
UP
O'
NIGHTS
FOR
HIM.
ALL
THIS
ENERGY
WAS
WASTED,
THOUGH.
'THAT
ANIMAL
HAS
A
CHARMED
LIFE,'
HE
SAID;
'BUT
YOU
CAN
SAY
THIS
ONLY
OF
BRUTES
IN
THIS
COUNTRY.
NO
MAN
--
YOU
APPREHEND
ME?
--
NO
MAN
HERE
BEARS
A
CHARMED
LIFE.'
HE
STOOD
THERE
FOR
A
MOMENT
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT
WITH
HIS
DELICATE
HOOKED
NOSE
SET
A
LITTLE
ASKEW,
AND
HIS
MICA
EYES
GLITTERING
WITHOUT
A
WINK,
THEN,
WITH
A
CURT
GOOD-
NIGHT,
HE
STRODE
OFF.
I
COULD
SEE
HE
WAS
DISTURBED
AND
CONSIDERABLY
PUZZLED,
WHICH
MADE
ME
FEEL
MORE
HOPE-
FUL
THAN
I
HAD
BEEN
FOR
DAYS.
IT
WAS
A
GREAT
COMFORT
TO
TURN
FROM
THAT
CHAP
TO
MY
INFLUENTIAL
FRIEND,
THE
BATTERED,
TWISTED,
RUINED,
TIN-POT
STEAMBOAT.
I
CLAM-
BERED
ON
BOARD.
SHE
RANG
UNDER
MY
FEET
LIKE
AN
EMPTY
HUNTLEY
&
PALMER
BISCUIT-TIN
KICKED
ALONG
A
GUTTER;
SHE
WAS
NOTHING
SO
SOLID
IN
MAKE,
AND
RATHER
LESS
PRETTY
IN
SHAPE,
BUT
I
HAD
EXPENDED
ENOUGH
HARD
WORK
ON
HER
TO
MAKE
ME
LOVE
HER.
NO
INFLUENTIAL
FRIEND
WOULD
HAVE
SERVED
ME
BETTER.
SHE
HAD
GIVEN
ME
A
CHANCE
TO
COME
OUT
A
BIT
--
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
I
COULD
DO.
NO,
I
DON'T
LIKE
WORK.
I
HAD
RATHER
LAZE
ABOUT
AND
THINK
OF
ALL
THE
FINE
THINGS
THAT
CAN
BE
DONE.
I
DON'T
LIKE
WORK
--
NO
MAN
DOES
--
BUT
I
LIKE
WHAT
IS
IN
THE
WORK
--
THE
CHANCE
TO
FIND
YOURSELF.
YOUR
OWN
REALITY
--
FOR
YOUR-
SELF,
NOT
FOR
OTHERS
--
WHAT
NO
OTHER
MAN
CAN
EVER
KNOW.
THEY
CAN
ONLY
SEE
THE
MERE
SHOW,
AND
NEVER
CAN
TELL
WHAT
IT
REALLY
MEANS.


"I
WAS
NOT
SURPRISED
TO
SEE
SOMEBODY
SITTING
AFT,
ON
THE
DECK,
WITH
HIS
LEGS
DANGLING
OVER
THE
MUD.
YOU
SEE
I
RATHER
CHUMMED
WITH
THE
FEW
MECHANICS
THERE
WERE
IN
THAT
STATION,
WHOM
THE
OTHER
PILGRIMS
NATUR-
ALLY
DESPISED
--
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THEIR
IMPERFECT
MANNERS,
I
SUPPOSE.
THIS
WAS
THE
FOREMAN
--
A
BOILER-MAKER
BY
TRADE
--
A
GOOD
WORKER.
HE
WAS
A
LANK,
BONY,
YELLOW-
FACED
MAN,
WITH
BIG
INTENSE
EYES.
HIS
ASPECT
WAS
WORRIED,
AND
HIS
HEAD
WAS
AS
BALD
AS
THE
PALM
OF
MY
HAND;
BUT
HIS
HAIR
IN
FALLING
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
STUCK
TO
HIS
CHIN,
AND
HAD
PROSPERED
IN
THE
NEW
LOCALITY,
FOR
HIS
BEARD
HUNG
DOWN
TO
HIS
WAIST.
HE
WAS
A
WIDOWER
WITH
SIX
YOUNG
CHILDREN
(HE
HAD
LEFT
THEM
IN
CHARGE
OF
A
SISTER
OF
HIS
TO
COME
OUT
THERE),
AND
THE
PASSION
OF
HIS
LIFE
WAS
PIGEON-FLYING.
HE
WAS
AN
ENTHUSIAST
AND
A
CONNOISSEUR.
HE
WOULD
RAVE
ABOUT
PIGEONS.
AFTER
WORK
HOURS
HE
USED
SOMETIMES
TO
COME
OVER
FROM
HIS
HUT
FOR
A
TALK
ABOUT
HIS
CHILDREN
AND
HIS
PIGEONS;
AT
WORK,
WHEN
HE
HAD
TO
CRAWL
IN
THE
MUD
UNDER
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
STEAMBOAT,
HE
WOULD
TIE
UP
THAT
BEARD
OF
HIS
IN
A
KIND
OF
WHITE
SERVIETTE
HE
BROUGHT
FOR
THE
PURPOSE.
IT
HAD
LOOPS
TO
GO
OVER
HIS
EARS.
IN
THE
EVE-
NING
HE
COULD
BE
SEEN
SQUATTED
ON
THE
BANK
RINSING
THAT
WRAPPER
IN
THE
CREEK
WITH
GREAT
CARE,
THEN
SPREADING
IT
SOLEMNLY
ON
A
BUSH
TO
DRY.



"I
SLAPPED
HIM
ON
THE
BACK
AND
SHOUTED,
'WE
SHALL
HAVE
RIVETS!'
HE
SCRAMBLED
TO
HIS
FEET
EXCLAIMING,
'NO!
RIVETS!'
AS
THOUGH
HE
COULDN'T
BELIEVE
HIS
EARS.
THEN
IN
A
LOW
VOICE,
'YOU
.
.
.
EH?'
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHY
WE
BEHAVED
LIKE
LUNATICS.
I
PUT
MY
FINGER
TO
THE
SIDE
OF
MY
NOSE
AND
NODDED
MYSTERIOUSLY.
'GOOD
FOR
YOU!'
HE
CRIED,
SNAPPED
HIS
FINGERS
ABOVE
HIS
HEAD,
LIFTING
ONE
FOOT.
I
TRIED
A
JIG.
WE
CAPERED
ON
THE
IRON
DECK.
A
FRIGHTFUL
CLATTER
CAME
OUT
OF
THAT
HULK,
AND
THE
VIRGIN
FOREST
ON
THE
OTHER
BANK
OF
THE
CREEK
SENT
IT
BACK
IN
A
THUNDERING
ROLL
UPON
THE
SLEEPING
STATION.
IT
MUST
HAVE
MADE
SOME
OF
THE
PILGRIMS
SIT
UP
IN
THEIR
HOVELS.
A
DARK
FIGURE
OBSCURED
THE
LIGHTED
DOORWAY
OF
THE
MANAGER'S
HUT,
VANISHED,
THEN,
A
SECOND
OR
SO
AFTER,
THE
DOORWAY
ITSELF
VANISHED,
TOO.
WE
STOPPED,
AND
THE
SILENCE
DRIVEN
AWAY
BY
THE
STAMPING
OF
OUR
FEET
FLOWED
BACK
AGAIN
FROM
THE
RECESSES
OF
THE
LAND.
THE
GREAT
WALL
OF
VEGETATION,
AN
EXUBERANT
AND
EN-
TANGLED
MASS
OF
TRUNKS,
BRANCHES,
LEAVES,
BOUGHS,
FES-
TOONS,
MOTIONLESS
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT,
WAS
LIKE
A
RIOTING
INVASION
OF
SOUNDLESS
LIFE,
A
ROLLING
WAVE
OF
PLANTS,
PILED
UP,
CRESTED,
READY
TO
TOPPLE
OVER
THE
CREEK,
TO
SWEEP
EVERY
LITTLE
MAN
OF
US
OUT
OF
HIS
LITTLE
EXISTENCE.
AND
IT
MOVED
NOT.
A
DEADENED
BURST
OF
MIGHTY
SPLASHES
AND
SNORTS
REACHED
US
FROM
AFAR,
AS
THOUGH
AN
ICHTHYOSAURUS
HAD
BEEN
TAKING
A
BATH
OF
GLITTER
IN
THE
GREAT
RIVER.
'AFTER
ALL,'
SAID
THE
BOILER-MAKER
IN
A
REASONABLE
TONE,
'WHY
SHOULDN'T
WE
GET
THE
RIVETS?'
WHY
NOT,
INDEED!
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
OF
ANY
REASON
WHY
WE
SHOULDN'T.
'THEY'LL
COME
IN
THREE
WEEKS,'
I
SAID,
CONFIDENTLY.


"BUT
THEY
DIDN'T.
INSTEAD
OF
RIVETS
THERE
CAME
AN
INVASION,
AN
INFLICTION,
A
VISITATION.
IT
CAME
IN
SECTIONS
DURING
THE
NEXT
THREE
WEEKS,
EACH
SECTION
HEADED
BY
A
DONKEY
CARRYING
A
WHITE
MAN
IN
NEW
CLOTHES
AND
TAN
SHOES,
BOWING
FROM
THAT
ELEVATION
RIGHT
AND
LEFT
TO
THE
IMPRESSED
PILGRIMS.
A
QUARRELSOME
BAND
OF
FOOTSORE
SULKY
NIGGERS
TROD
ON
THE
HEELS
OF
THE
DON-
KEY;
A
LOT
OF
TENTS,
CAMPSTOOLS,
TIN
BOXES,
WHITE
CASES,
BROWN
BALES
WOULD
BE
SHOT
DOWN
IN
THE
COURT-YARD,
AND
THE
AIR
OF
MYSTERY
WOULD
DEEPEN
A
LITTLE
OVER
THE
MUDDLE
OF
THE
STATION.
FIVE
SUCH
INSTALMENTS
CAME,
WITH
THEIR
ABSURD
AIR
OF
DISORDERLY
FLIGHT
WITH
THE
LOOT
OF
INNUMERABLE
OUTFIT
SHOPS
AND
PROVISION
STORES,
THAT,
ONE
WOULD
THINK,
THEY
WERE
LUGGING,
AFTER
A
RAID,
INTO
THE
WILDERNESS
FOR
EQUITABLE
DIVISION.
IT
WAS
AN
INEXTRICABLE
MESS
OF
THINGS
DECENT
IN
THEMSELVES
BUT
THAT
HUMAN
FOLLY
MADE
LOOK
LIKE
THE
SPOILS
OF
THIEVING.


"THIS
DEVOTED
BAND
CALLED
ITSELF
THE
ELDORADO
EXPLORING
EXPEDITION,
AND
I
BELIEVE
THEY
WERE
SWORN
TO
SECRECY.
THEIR
TALK,
HOWEVER,
WAS
THE
TALK
OF
SORDID
BUCCANEERS:
IT
WAS
RECKLESS
WITHOUT
HARDIHOOD,
GREEDY
WITHOUT
AUDACITY,
AND
CRUEL
WITHOUT
COURAGE;
THERE
WAS
NOT
AN
ATOM
OF
FORESIGHT
OR
OF
SERIOUS
INTENTION
IN
THE
WHOLE
BATCH
OF
THEM,
AND
THEY
DID
NOT
SEEM
AWARE
THESE
THINGS
ARE
WANTED
FOR
THE
WORK
OF
THE
WORLD.
TO
TEAR
TREASURE
OUT
OF
THE
BOWELS
OF
THE
LAND
WAS
THEIR
DESIRE,
WITH
NO
MORE
MORAL
PURPOSE
AT
THE
BACK
OF
IT
THAN
THERE
IS
IN
BURGLARS
BREAKING
INTO
A
SAFE.
WHO
PAID
THE
EXPENSES
OF
THE
NOBLE
ENTERPRISE
I
DON'T
KNOW;
BUT
THE
UNCLE
OF
OUR
MANAGER
WAS
LEADER
OF
THAT
LOT.


"IN
EXTERIOR
HE
RESEMBLED
A
BUTCHER
IN
A
POOR
NEIGH-
BOURHOOD,
AND
HIS
EYES
HAD
A
LOOK
OF
SLEEPY
CUNNING.
HE
CARRIED
HIS
FAT
PAUNCH
WITH
OSTENTATION
ON
HIS
SHORT
LEGS,
AND
DURING
THE
TIME
HIS
GANG
INFESTED
THE
STATION
SPOKE
TO
NO
ONE
BUT
HIS
NEPHEW.
YOU
COULD
SEE
THESE
TWO
ROAMING
ABOUT
ALL
DAY
LONG
WITH
THEIR
HEADS
CLOSE
TOGETHER
IN
AN
EVERLASTING
CONFAB.


"I
HAD
GIVEN
UP
WORRYING
MYSELF
ABOUT
THE
RIVETS.
ONE'S
CAPACITY
FOR
THAT
KIND
OF
FOLLY
IS
MORE
LIMITED
THAN
YOU
WOULD
SUPPOSE.
I
SAID
HANG!
--
AND
LET
THINGS
SLIDE.
I
HAD
PLENTY
OF
TIME
FOR
MEDITATION,
AND
NOW
AND
THEN
I
WOULD
GIVE
SOME
THOUGHT
TO
KURTZ.
I
WASN'T
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
HIM.
NO.
STILL,
I
WAS
CURIOUS
TO
SEE
WHETHER
THIS
MAN,
WHO
HAD
COME
OUT
EQUIPPED
WITH
MORAL
IDEAS
OF
SOME
SORT,
WOULD
CLIMB
TO
THE
TOP
AFTER
ALL
AND
HOW
HE
WOULD
SET
ABOUT
HIS
WORK
WHEN
THERE."

























II



"ONE
EVENING
AS
I
WAS
LYING
FLAT
ON
THE
DECK
OF
MY
STEAMBOAT,
I
HEARD
VOICES
APPROACHING
--
AND
THERE
WERE
THE
NEPHEW
AND
THE
UNCLE
STROLLING
ALONG
THE
BANK.
I
LAID
MY
HEAD
ON
MY
ARM
AGAIN,
AND
HAD
NEARLY
LOST
MYSELF
IN
A
DOZE,
WHEN
SOMEBODY
SAID
IN
MY
EAR,
AS
IT
WERE:
'I
AM
AS
HARMLESS
AS
A
LITTLE
CHILD,
BUT
I
DON'T
LIKE
TO
BE
DICTATED
TO.
AM
I
THE
MANAGER
--
OR
AM
I
NOT?
I
WAS
ORDERED
TO
SEND
HIM
THERE.
IT'S
INCRED-
IBLE.'.
.
.
I
BECAME
AWARE
THAT
THE
TWO
WERE
STANDING
ON
THE
SHORE
ALONGSIDE
THE
FOREPART
OF
THE
STEAMBOAT,
JUST
BELOW
MY
HEAD.
I
DID
NOT
MOVE;
IT
DID
NOT
OCCUR
TO
ME
TO
MOVE:
I
WAS
SLEEPY.
'IT
IS
UNPLEASANT,'
GRUNTED
THE
UNCLE.
'HE
HAS
ASKED
THE
ADMINISTRATION
TO
BE
SENT
THERE,'
SAID
THE
OTHER,
'WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
SHOW-
ING
WHAT
HE
COULD
DO;
AND
I
WAS
INSTRUCTED
ACCORD-
INGLY.
LOOK
AT
THE
INFLUENCE
THAT
MAN
MUST
HAVE.
IS
IT
NOT
FRIGHTFUL?'
THEY
BOTH
AGREED
IT
WAS
FRIGHTFUL,
THEN
MADE
SEVERAL
BIZARRE
REMARKS:
'MAKE
RAIN
AND
FINE
WEATHER
--
ONE
MAN
--
THE
COUNCIL
--
BY
THE
NOSE'
--
BITS
OF
ABSURD
SENTENCES
THAT
GOT
THE
BETTER
OF
MY
DROWSINESS,
SO
THAT
I
HAD
PRETTY
NEAR
THE
WHOLE
OF
MY
WITS
ABOUT
ME
WHEN
THE
UNCLE
SAID,
'THE
CLIMATE
MAY
DO
AWAY
WITH
THIS
DIFFICULTY
FOR
YOU.
IS
HE
ALONE
THERE?'
'YES,'
ANSWERED
THE
MANAGER;
'HE
SENT
HIS
ASSISTANT
DOWN
THE
RIVER
WITH
A
NOTE
TO
ME
IN
THESE
TERMS:
"CLEAR
THIS
POOR
DEVIL
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY,
AND
DON'T
BOTHER
SENDING
MORE
OF
THAT
SORT.
I
HAD
RATHER
BE
ALONE
THAN
HAVE
THE
KIND
OF
MEN
YOU
CAN
DISPOSE
OF
WITH
ME."
IT
WAS
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
AGO.
CAN
YOU
IM-
AGINE
SUCH
IMPUDENCE!'
'ANYTHING
SINCE
THEN?'
ASKED
THE
OTHER
HOARSELY.
'IVORY,'
JERKED
THE
NEPHEW;
'LOTS
OF
IT
--
PRIME
SORT
--
LOTS
--
MOST
ANNOYING,
FROM
HIM.'
'AND
WITH
THAT?'
QUESTIONED
THE
HEAVY
RUMBLE.
'IN-
VOICE,'
WAS
THE
REPLY
FIRED
OUT,
SO
TO
SPEAK.
THEN
SI-
LENCE.
THEY
HAD
BEEN
TALKING
ABOUT
KURTZ.


"I
WAS
BROAD
AWAKE
BY
THIS
TIME,
BUT,
LYING
PER-
FECTLY
AT
EASE,
REMAINED
STILL,
HAVING
NO
INDUCEMENT
TO
CHANGE
MY
POSITION.
'HOW
DID
THAT
IVORY
COME
ALL
THIS
WAY?'
GROWLED
THE
ELDER
MAN,
WHO
SEEMED
VERY
VEXED.
THE
OTHER
EXPLAINED
THAT
IT
HAD
COME
WITH
A
FLEET
OF
CANOES
IN
CHARGE
OF
AN
ENGLISH
HALF-CASTE
CLERK
KURTZ
HAD
WITH
HIM;
THAT
KURTZ
HAD
APPARENTLY
INTENDED
TO
RETURN
HIMSELF,
THE
STATION
BEING
BY
THAT
TIME
BARE
OF
GOODS
AND
STORES,
BUT
AFTER
COMING
THREE
HUNDRED
MILES,
HAD
SUDDENLY
DECIDED
TO
GO
BACK,
WHICH
HE
STARTED
TO
DO
ALONE
IN
A
SMALL
DUGOUT
WITH
FOUR
PADDLERS,
LEAVING
THE
HALF-CASTE
TO
CONTINUE
DOWN
THE
RIVER
WITH
THE
IVORY.
THE
TWO
FELLOWS
THERE
SEEMED
ASTOUNDED
AT
ANYBODY
ATTEMPTING
SUCH
A
THING.
THEY

WERE
AT
A
LOSS
FOR
AN
ADEQUATE
MOTIVE.
AS
TO
ME,
I
SEEMED
TO
SEE
KURTZ
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME.
IT
WAS
A
DISTINCT
GLIMPSE:
THE
DUGOUT,
FOUR
PADDLING
SAVAGES,
AND
THE
LONE
WHITE
MAN
TURNING
HIS
BACK
SUDDENLY
ON
THE
HEADQUARTERS,
ON
RELIEF,
ON
THOUGHTS
OF
HOME
--
PER-
HAPS;
SETTING
HIS
FACE
TOWARDS
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
WIL-
DERNESS,
TOWARDS
HIS
EMPTY
AND
DESOLATE
STATION.
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
THE
MOTIVE.
PERHAPS
HE
WAS
JUST
SIMPLY
A
FINE
FELLOW
WHO
STUCK
TO
HIS
WORK
FOR
ITS
OWN
SAKE.
HIS
NAME,
YOU
UNDERSTAND,
HAD
NOT
BEEN
PRONOUNCED
ONCE.
HE
WAS
'THAT
MAN.'
THE
HALF
CASTE,
WHO,
AS
FAR
AS
I
COULD
SEE,
HAD
CONDUCTED
A
DIFFICULT
TRIP
WITH
GREAT
PRUDENCE
AND
PLUCK,
WAS
INVARIABLY
ALLUDED
TO
AS
'THAT
SCOUNDREL.'
THE
'SCOUNDREL'
HAD
REPORTED
THAT
THE
'MAN'
HAD
BEEN
VERY
ILL
--
HAD
RECOVERED
IMPER-
FECTLY....
THE
TWO
BELOW
ME
MOVED
AWAY
THEN
A
FEW
PACES,
AND
STROLLED
BACK
AND
FORTH
AT
SOME
LITTLE
DISTANCE.
I
HEARD:
'MILITARY
POST
--
DOCTOR
--
TWO
HUN-
DRED
MILES
--
QUITE
ALONE
NOW
--
UNAVOIDABLE
DELAYS
--
NINE
MONTHS
--
NO
NEWS
--
STRANGE
RUMOURS.'
THEY
AP-
PROACHED
AGAIN,
JUST
AS
THE
MANAGER
WAS
SAYING,
'NO
ONE,
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW,
UNLESS
A
SPECIES
OF
WANDERING
TRADER
--
A
PESTILENTIAL
FELLOW,
SNAPPING
IVORY
FROM
THE
NATIVES.'
WHO
WAS
IT
THEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
NOW?
I
GATHERED
IN
SNATCHES
THAT
THIS
WAS
SOME
MAN
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IN
KURTZ'S
DISTRICT,
AND
OF
WHOM
THE
MANAGER
DID
NOT
APPROVE.
'WE
WILL
NOT
BE
FREE
FROM
UNFAIR
COMPETITION
TILL
ONE
OF
THESE
FELLOWS
IS
HANGED
FOR
AN
EXAMPLE,'
HE
SAID.
'CERTAINLY,'
GRUNTED
THE
OTHER;
'GET
HIM
HANGED!
WHY
NOT?
ANYTHING
--
ANYTHING
CAN
BE
DONE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY.
THAT'S
WHAT
I
SAY;
NOBODY
HERE,
YOU
UNDERSTAND,
HERE,
CAN
ENDANGER
YOUR
POSITION.
AND
WHY?
YOU
STAND
THE
CLIMATE
--
YOU
OUTLAST
THEM
ALL.
THE
DANGER
IS
IN
EUROPE;
BUT
THERE
BEFORE
I
LEFT
I
TOOK
CARE
TO
--'
THEY
MOVED
OFF
AND
WHISPERED,
THEN
THEIR
VOICES
ROSE
AGAIN.
'THE
EXTRAORDINARY
SERIES
OF
DELAYS
IS
NOT
MY
FAULT.
I
DID
MY
BEST.'
THE
FAT
MAN
SIGHED.
'VERY
SAD.'
'AND
THE
PESTIFEROUS
ABSURDITY
OF
HIS
TALK,'
CONTINUED
THE
OTHER;
'HE
BOTHERED
ME
ENOUGH
WHEN
HE
WAS
HERE.
"EACH
STATION
SHOULD
BE
LIKE
A
BEACON
ON
THE
ROAD
TOWARDS
BETTER
THINGS,
A
CENTRE
FOR
TRADE
OF
COURSE,
BUT
ALSO
FOR
HUMANIZING,
IMPROVING,
INSTRUCTING."
CONCEIVE
YOU
--
THAT
ASS!
AND
HE
WANTS
TO
BE
MANAGER!
NO,
IT'S
--'
HERE
HE
GOT
CHOKED
BY
EXCESSIVE
INDIGNATION,
AND
I
LIFTED
MY
HEAD
THE
LEAST
BIT.
I
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
SEE
HOW
NEAR
THEY
WERE
--
RIGHT
UNDER
ME.
I
COULD
HAVE
SPAT
UPON
THEIR
HATS.
THEY
WERE
LOOKING
ON
THE
GROUND,
ABSORBED
IN
THOUGHT.
THE
MANAGER
WAS
SWITCHING
HIS
LEG
WITH
A
SLENDER
TWIG:
HIS
SAGACIOUS
RELATIVE
LIFTED
HIS
HEAD.
'YOU
HAVE
BEEN
WELL
SINCE
YOU
CAME
OUT
THIS
TIME?'
HE
ASKED.
THE
OTHER
GAVE
A
START.
'WHO?
I?
OH!
LIKE
A
CHARM
--
LIKE
A
CHARM.
BUT
THE
REST
--
OH,
MY
GOODNESS!
ALL
SICK.
THEY
DIE
SO
QUICK,
TOO,
THAT
I
HAVEN'T
THE
TIME
TO
SEND
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
--
IT'S
INCREDIBLE!'
'H'M.
JUST
SO,'
GRUNTED
THE
UNCLE.
'AH!
MY
BOY,
TRUST
TO
THIS
--
I
SAY,
TRUST
TO
THIS.'
I
SAW
HIM
EXTEND
HIS
SHORT
FLIPPER
OF
AN
ARM
FOR
A
GESTURE
THAT
TOOK
IN
THE
FOREST,
THE
CREEK,
THE
MUD,
THE
RIVER
--
SEEMED
TO
BECKON
WITH
A
DISHONOURING
FLOURISH
BEFORE
THE
SUNLIT
FACE
OF
THE
LAND
A
TREACHEROUS
APPEAL
TO
THE
LURKING
DEATH,
TO
THE
HIDDEN
EVIL,
TO
THE
PROFOUND
DARKNESS
OF
ITS
HEART.
IT
WAS
SO
STARTLING
THAT
I
LEAPED
TO
MY
FEET
AND
LOOKED
BACK
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
FOREST,
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
EXPECTED
AN
ANSWER
OF
SOME
SORT
TO
THAT
BLACK
DISPLAY
OF
CONFIDENCE.
YOU
KNOW
THE
FOOLISH
NOTIONS
THAT
COME
TO
ONE
SOMETIMES.
THE
HIGH
STILLNESS
CON-
FRONTED
THESE
TWO
FIGURES
WITH
ITS
OMINOUS
PATIENCE,
WAITING
FOR
THE
PASSING
AWAY
OF
A
FANTASTIC
INVASION.


"THEY
SWORE
ALOUD
TOGETHER
--
OUT
OF
SHEER
FRIGHT,
I
BELIEVE
--
THEN
PRETENDING
NOT
TO
KNOW
ANYTHING
OF
MY
EXISTENCE,
TURNED
BACK
TO
THE
STATION.
THE
SUN
WAS
LOW;
AND
LEANING
FORWARD
SIDE
BY
SIDE,
THEY
SEEMED
TO
BE
TUGGING
PAINFULLY
UPHILL
THEIR
TWO
RIDICULOUS
SHADOWS
OF
UNEQUAL
LENGTH,
THAT
TRAILED
BEHIND
THEM
SLOWLY
OVER
THE
TALL
GRASS
WITHOUT
BENDING
A
SINGLE
BLADE.


"IN
A
FEW
DAYS
THE
ELDORADO
EXPEDITION
WENT
INTO
THE
PATIENT
WILDERNESS,
THAT
DOSED
UPON
IT
AS
THE
SEA
CLOSES
OVER
A
DIVER.
LONG
AFTERWARDS
THE
NEWS
CAME
THAT
ALL
THE
DONKEYS
WERE
DEAD.
I
KNOW
NOTHING
AS
TO
THE
FATE
OF
THE
LESS
VALUABLE
ANIMALS.
THEY,
NO
DOUBT,
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
US,
FOUND
WHAT
THEY
DESERVED.
I
DID
NOT
INQUIRE.
I
WAS
THEN
RATHER
EXCITED
AT
THE
PROSPECT
OF
MEETING
KURTZ
VERY
SOON.
WHEN
I
SAY
VERY
SOON
I
MEAN
IT
COMPARATIVELY.
IT
WAS
JUST
TWO
MONTHS
FROM
THE
DAY
WE
LEFT
THE
CREEK
WHEN
WE
CAME
TO
THE
BANK
BELOW
KURTZ'S
STATION.


"GOING
UP
THAT
RIVER
WAS
LIKE
TRAVELLING
BACK
TO
THE
EARLIEST
BEGINNINGS
OF
THE
WORLD,
WHEN
VEGETATION
RIOTED
ON
THE
EARTH
AND
THE
BIG
TREES
WERE
KINGS.
AN
EMPTY
STREAM,
A
GREAT
SILENCE,
AN
IMPENETRABLE
FOREST.
THE
AIR
WAS
WARM,
THICK,
HEAVY,
SLUGGISH.
THERE
WAS
NO
JOY
IN
THE
BRILLIANCE
OF
SUNSHINE.
THE
LONG
STRETCHES
OF
THE
WATERWAY
RAN
ON,
DESERTED,
INTO
THE
GLOOM
OF
OVER-SHADOWED
DISTANCES.
ON
SILVERY
SANDBANKS
HIPPOS
AND
ALLIGATORS
SUNNED
THEMSELVES
SIDE
BY
SIDE.
THE
BROADENING
WATERS
FLOWED
THROUGH
A
MOB
OF
WOODED
ISLANDS;
YOU
LOST
YOUR
WAY
ON
THAT
RIVER
AS
YOU
WOULD
IN
A
DESERT,
AND
BUTTED
ALL
DAY
LONG
AGAINST
SHOALS,
TRYING
TO
FIND
THE
CHANNEL,
TILL
YOU
THOUGHT
YOURSELF
BEWITCHED
AND
CUT
OFF
FOR
EVER
FROM
EVERYTHING
YOU
HAD
KNOWN
ONCE
--
SOMEWHERE
--
FAR
AWAY
--
IN
ANOTHER
EXISTENCE
PERHAPS.
THERE
WERE
MOMENTS
WHEN
ONE'S
PAST
CAME
BACK
TO
ONE,
AS
IT
WILL
SOMETIMES
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
NOT
A
MOMENT
TO
SPARE
TO
YOURSELF;
BUT
IT
CAME
IN
THE
SHAPE
OF
AN
UNRESTFUL
AND
NOISY
DREAM,
REMEMBERED
WITH
WONDER
AMONGST
THE
OVERWHELMING
REALITIES
OF
THIS
STRANGE
WORLD
OF
PLANTS,
AND
WATER,
AND
SILENCE.
AND
THIS
STILLNESS
OF
LIFE
DID
NOT
IN
THE
LEAST
RESEMBLE
A
PEACE.
IT
WAS
THE
STILLNESS
OF
AN
IMPLACABLE
FORCE
BROODING
OVER
AN
INSCRUTABLE
INTENTION.
IT
LOOKED
AT
YOU
WITH
A
VENGEFUL
ASPECT.
I
GOT
USED
TO
IT
AFTERWARDS;
I
DID
NOT
SEE
IT
ANY
MORE;
I
HAD
NO
TIME.
I
HAD
TO
KEEP
GUESSING
AT
THE
CHANNEL;
I
HAD
TO
DISCERN,
MOSTLY
BY
INSPIRATION,
THE
SIGNS
OF
HIDDEN
BANKS;
I
WATCHED
FOR
SUNKEN
STONES;
I
WAS
LEARNING
TO
CLAP
MY
TEETH
SMARTLY
BEFORE
MY
HEART
FLEW
OUT,
WHEN
I
SHAVED
BY
A
FLUKE
SOME
INFERNAL
SLY
OLD
SNAG
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
RIPPED
THE
LIFE
OUT
OF
THE
TIN-POT
STEAMBOAT
AND
DROWNED
ALL
THE
PILGRIMS;
I
HAD
TO
KEEP
A
LOOKOUT
FOR
THE
SIGNS
OF
DEAD
WOOD
WE
COULD
CUT
UP
IN
THE
NIGHT
FOR
NEXT
DAY'S
STEAMING.
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
ATTEND
TO
THINGS
OF
THAT
SORT,
TO
THE
MERE
INCIDENTS
OF
THE
SURFACE,
THE
REALITY
--
THE
REALITY,
I
TELL
YOU
--
FADES.
THE
INNER
TRUTH
IS
HID-
DEN
--
LUCKILY,
LUCKILY.
BUT
I
FELT
IT
ALL
THE
SAME;
I
FELT
OFTEN
ITS
MYSTERIOUS
STILLNESS
WATCHING
ME
AT
MY
MONKEY
TRICKS,
JUST
AS
IT
WATCHES
YOU
FELLOWS
PERFORM-
ING
ON
YOUR
RESPECTIVE
TIGHT-ROPES
FOR
--
WHAT
IS
IT?
HALF-A-CROWN
A
TUMBLE
--"


"TRY
TO
BE
CIVIL,
MARLOW,"
GROWLED
A
VOICE,
AND
I
KNEW
THERE
WAS
AT
LEAST
ONE
LISTENER
AWAKE
BESIDES
MYSELF.


"I
BEG
YOUR
PARDON.
I
FORGOT
THE
HEARTACHE
WHICH
MAKES
UP
THE
REST
OF
THE
PRICE.
AND
INDEED
WHAT
DOES
THE
PRICE
MATTER,
IF
THE
TRICK
BE
WELL
DONE?
YOU
DO
YOUR
TRICKS
VERY
WELL.
AND
I
DIDN'T
DO
BADLY
EITHER,
SINCE
I
MANAGED
NOT
TO
SINK
THAT
STEAMBOAT
ON
MY
FIRST
TRIP.
IT'S
A
WONDER
TO
ME
YET.
IMAGINE
A
BLINDFOLDED
MAN
SET
TO
DRIVE
A
VAN
OVER
A
BAD
ROAD.
I
SWEATED
AND
SHIVERED
OVER
THAT
BUSINESS
CONSIDERABLY,
I
CAN
TELL
YOU.
AFTER
ALL,
FOR
A
SEAMAN,
TO
SCRAPE
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
THING
THAT'S
SUPPOSED
TO
FLOAT
ALL
THE
TIME
UNDER
HIS
CARE
IS
THE
UNPARDONABLE
SIN.
NO
ONE
MAY
KNOW
OF
IT,
BUT
YOU
NEVER
FORGET
THE
THUMP
--
EH?
A
BLOW
ON
THE
VERY
HEART.
YOU
REMEMBER
IT,
YOU
DREAM
OF
IT,
YOU
WAKE
UP
AT
NIGHT
AND
THINK
OF
IT
--
YEARS
AFTER
--
AND
GO
HOT
AND
COLD
ALL
OVER.
I
DON'T
PRETEND
TO
SAY
THAT
STEAMBOAT
FLOATED
ALL
THE
TIME.
MORE
THAN
ONCE
SHE
HAD
TO
WADE
FOR
A
BIT,
WITH
TWENTY
CANNIBALS
SPLASHING
AROUND
AND
PUSHING.
WE
HAD
ENLISTED
SOME
OF
THESE
CHAPS
ON
THE
WAY
FOR
A
CREW.
FINE
FELLOWS
--
CANNIBALS
--
IN
THEIR
PLACE.
THEY
WERE
MEN
ONE
COULD
WORK
WITH,
AND
I
AM
GRATEFUL
TO
THEM.
AND,
AFTER
ALL,
THEY
DID
NOT
EAT
EACH
OTHER
BEFORE
MY
FACE:
THEY
HAD
BROUGHT
ALONG
A
PROVISION
OF
HIPPO-MEAT
WHICH
WENT
ROTTEN,
AND
MADE
THE
MYSTERY
OF
THE
WILDERNESS
STINK
IN
MY
NOSTRILS.
PHOO!
I
CAN
SNIFF
IT
NOW.
I
HAD
THE
MANAGER
ON
BOARD
AND
THREE
OR
FOUR
PILGRIMS
WITH
THEIR
STAVES
--
ALL
COMPLETE.
SOMETIMES
WE
CAME
UPON
A
STATION
CLOSE
BY
THE
BANK,
CLINGING
TO
THE
SKIRTS
OF
THE
UN-
KNOWN,
AND
THE
WHITE
MEN
RUSHING
OUT
OF
A
TUMBLE-
DOWN
HOVEL,
WITH
GREAT
GESTURES
OF
JOY
AND
SURPRISE
AND
WELCOME,
SEEMED
VERY
STRANGE
--
HAD
THE
APPEAR-
ANCE
OF
BEING
HELD
THERE
CAPTIVE
BY
A
SPELL.
THE
WORD
IVORY
WOULD
RING
IN
THE
AIR
FOR
A
WHILE
--
AND
ON
WE
WENT
AGAIN
INTO
THE
SILENCE,
ALONG
EMPTY
REACHES,
ROUND
THE
STILL
BENDS,
BETWEEN
THE
HIGH
WALLS
OF
OUR
WINDING
WAY,
REVERBERATING
IN
HOLLOW
CLAPS
THE
PON-
DEROUS
BEAT
OF
THE
STERN-WHEEL.
TREES,
TREES,
MILLIONS
OF
TREES,
MASSIVE,
IMMENSE,
RUNNING
UP
HIGH;
AND
AT
THEIR
FOOT,
HUGGING
THE
BANK
AGAINST
THE
STREAM,
CREPT
THE
LITTLE
BEGRIMED
STEAMBOAT,
LIKE
A
SLUGGISH
BEETLE
CRAWLING
ON
THE
FLOOR
OF
A
LOFTY
PORTICO.
IT
MADE
YOU
FEEL
VERY
SMALL,
VERY
LOST,
AND
YET
IT
WAS
NOT
ALTO-
GETHER
DEPRESSING,
THAT
FEELING.
AFTER
ALL,
IF
YOU
WERE
SMALL,
THE
GRIMY
BEETLE
CRAWLED
ON
--
WHICH
WAS
JUST
WHAT
YOU
WANTED
IT
TO
DO.
WHERE
THE
PILGRIMS
IM-
AGINED
IT
CRAWLED
TO
I
DON'T
KNOW.
TO
SOME
PLACE
WHERE
THEY
EXPECTED
TO
GET
SOMETHING.
I
BET!
FOR
ME
IT
CRAWLED
TOWARDS
KURTZ
--
EXCLUSIVELY;
BUT
WHEN
THE
STEAM-PIPES
STARTED
LEAKING
WE
CRAWLED
VERY
SLOW.
THE
REACHES
OPENED
BEFORE
US
AND
CLOSED
BEHIND,
AS
IF
THE
FOREST
HAD
STEPPED
LEISURELY
ACROSS
THE
WATER
TO
BAR
THE
WAY
FOR
OUR
RETURN.
WE
PENETRATED
DEEPER
AND
DEEPER
INTO
THE
HEART
OF
DARKNESS.
IT
WAS
VERY
QUIET
THERE.
AT
NIGHT
SOMETIMES
THE
ROLL
OF
DRUMS
BEHIND
THE
CURTAIN
OF
TREES
WOULD
RUN
UP
THE
RIVER
AND
REMAIN
SUSTAINED
FAINTLY,
AS
IF
HOVERING
IN
THE
AIR
HIGH
OVER
OUR
HEADS,
TILL
THE
FIRST
BREAK
OF
DAY.
WHETHER
IT
MEANT
WAR,
PEACE,
OR
PRAYER
WE
COULD
NOT
TELL.
THE
DAWNS
WERE
HERALDED
BY
THE
DESCENT
OF
A
CHILL
STILLNESS;
THE
WOOD-CUTTERS
SLEPT,
THEIR
FIRES
BURNED
LOW;
THE
SNAP-
PING
OF
A
TWIG
WOULD
MAKE
YOU
START.
WE
WERE
WAN-
DERERS
ON
A
PREHISTORIC
EARTH,
ON
AN
EARTH
THAT
WORE
THE
ASPECT
OF
AN
UNKNOWN
PLANET.
WE
COULD
HAVE
FANCIED
OURSELVES
THE
FIRST
OF
MEN
TAKING
POSSESSION
OF
AN
AC-
CURSED
INHERITANCE,
TO
BE
SUBDUED
AT
THE
COST
OF
PRO-
FOUND
ANGUISH
AND
OF
EXCESSIVE
TOIL.
BUT
SUDDENLY,
AS
WE
STRUGGLED
ROUND
A
BEND,
THERE
WOULD
BE
A
GLIMPSE
OF
RUSH
WALLS,
OF
PEAKED
GRASS-ROOFS,
A
BURST
OF
YELLS,
A
WHIRL
OF
BLACK
LIMBS,
A
MASS
OF
HANDS
CLAP-
PING,
OF
FEET
STAMPING,
OF
BODIES
SWAYING,
OF
EYES
ROLLING,
UNDER
THE
DROOP
OF
HEAVY
AND
MOTIONLESS
FOLIAGE.
THE
STEAMER
TOILED
ALONG
SLOWLY
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
A
BLACK
AND
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
FRENZY.
THE
PREHIS-
TORIC
MAN
WAS
CURSING
US,
PRAYING
TO
US,
WELCOMING
US
--
WHO
COULD
TELL?
WE
WERE
CUT
OFF
FROM
THE
COMPRE-
HENSION
OF
OUR
SURROUNDINGS;
WE
GLIDED
PAST
LIKE
PHANTOMS,
WONDERING
AND
SECRETLY
APPALLED,
AS
SANE
MEN
WOULD
BE
BEFORE
AN
ENTHUSIASTIC
OUTBREAK
IN
A
MADHOUSE.
WE
COULD
NOT
UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE
WE
WERE
TOO
FAR
AND
COULD
NOT
REMEMBER
BECAUSE
WE
WERE
TRAVELLING
IN
THE
NIGHT
OF
FIRST
AGES,
OF
THOSE
AGES
THAT
ARE
GONE,
LEAVING
HARDLY
A
SIGN
--
AND
NO
MEMORIES.


"THE
EARTH
SEEMED
UNEARTHLY.
WE
ARE
ACCUSTOMED
TO
LOOK
UPON
THE
SHACKLED
FORM
OF
A
CONQUERED
MON-
STER,
BUT
THERE
--
THERE
YOU
COULD
LOOK
AT
A
THING
MON-
STROUS
AND
FREE.
IT
WAS
UNEARTHLY,
AND
THE
MEN
WERE
--
NO,
THEY
WERE
NOT
INHUMAN.
WELL,
YOU
KNOW,
THAT
WAS
THE
WORST
OF
IT
--
THIS
SUSPICION
OF
THEIR
NOT
BEING
INHUMAN.
IT
WOULD
COME
SLOWLY
TO
ONE.
THEY
HOWLED
AND
LEAPED,
AND
SPUN,
AND
MADE
HORRID
FACES;
BUT
WHAT
THRILLED
YOU
WAS
JUST
THE
THOUGHT
OF
THEIR
HUMANITY
--
LIKE
YOURS
--
THE
THOUGHT
OF
YOUR
REMOTE
KINSHIP
WITH
THIS
WILD
AND
PASSIONATE
UPROAR.
UGLY.
YES,
IT
WAS
UGLY
ENOUGH;
BUT
IF
YOU
WERE
MAN
ENOUGH
YOU
WOULD
ADMIT
TO
YOURSELF
THAT
THERE
WAS
IN
YOU
JUST
THE
FAINTEST
TRACE
OF
A
RESPONSE
TO
THE
TERRIBLE
FRANK-
NESS
OF
THAT
NOISE,
A
DIM
SUSPICION
OF
THERE
BEING
A
MEANING
IN
IT
WHICH
YOU
--
YOU
SO
REMOTE
FROM
THE
NIGHT
OF
FIRST
AGES
--
COULD
COMPREHEND.
AND
WHY
NOT?
THE
MIND
OF
MAN
IS
CAPABLE
OF
ANYTHING
--
BECAUSE
EVERYTHING
IS
IN
IT,
ALL
THE
PAST
AS
WELL
AS
ALL
THE
FUTURE.
WHAT
WAS
THERE
AFTER
ALL?
JOY,
FEAR,
SORROW,
DEVOTION,
VALOUR,
RAGE
--
WHO
CAN
TELL?
--
BUT
TRUTH
--
TRUTH
STRIPPED
OF
ITS
CLOAK
OF
TIME.
LET
THE
FOOL
GAPE
AND
SHUDDER
--
THE
MAN
KNOWS,
AND
CAN
LOOK
ON
WITHOUT
A
WINK.
BUT
HE
MUST
AT
LEAST
BE
AS
MUCH
OF
A
MAN
AS
THESE
ON
THE
SHORE.
HE
MUST
MEET
THAT
TRUTH
WITH
HIS
OWN
TRUE
STUFF
--
WITH
HIS
OWN
INBORN
STRENGTH.
PRINCI-
PLES
WON'T
DO.
ACQUISITIONS,
CLOTHES,
PRETTY
RAGS
--
RAGS
THAT
WOULD
FLY
OFF
AT
THE
FIRST
GOOD
SHAKE.
NO;
YOU
WANT
A
DELIBERATE
BELIEF.
AN
APPEAL
TO
ME
IN
THIS
FIEND-
ISH
ROW
--
IS
THERE?
VERY
WELL;
I
HEAR;
I
ADMIT,
BUT
I
HAVE
A
VOICE,
TOO,
AND
FOR
GOOD
OR
EVIL
MINE
IS
THE
SPEECH
THAT
CANNOT
BE
SILENCED.
OF
COURSE,
A
FOOL,
WHAT
WITH
SHEER
FRIGHT
AND
FINE
SENTIMENTS,
IS
ALWAYS
SAFE.
WHO'S
THAT
GRUNTING?
YOU
WONDER
I
DIDN'T
GO
ASHORE
FOR
A
HOWL
AND
A
DANCE?
WELL,
NO
--
I
DIDN'T.
FINE
SENTIMENTS,
YOU
SAY?
FINE
SENTIMENTS,
BE
HANGED!
I
HAD
NO
TIME.
I
HAD
TO
MESS
ABOUT
WITH
WHITE-LEAD
AND
STRIPS
OF
WOOLEN
BLANKET
HELPING
TO
PUT
BANDAGES
ON
THOSE
LEAKY
STEAMPIPES
--
I
TELL
YOU.
I
HAD
TO
WATCH
THE
STEERING,
AND
CIRCUMVENT
THOSE
SNAGS,
AND
GET
THE
TIN-POT
ALONG
BY
HOOK
OR
BY
CROOK.
THERE
WAS
SURFACE-
TRUTH
ENOUGH
IN
THESE
THINGS
TO
SAVE
A
WISER
MAN.
AND
BETWEEN
WHILES
I
HAD
TO
LOOK
AFTER
THE
SAVAGE
WHO
WAS
FIREMAN.
HE
WAS
AN
IMPROVED
SPECIMEN;
HE
COULD
FIRE
UP
A
VERTICAL
BOILER.
HE
WAS
THERE
BELOW
ME,
AND,
UPON
MY
WORD,
TO
LOOK
AT
HIM
WAS
AS
EDIFYING
AS
SEEING
A
DOG
IN
A
PARODY
OF
BREECHES
AND
A
FEATHER
HAT,
WALKING
ON
HIS
HINDLEGS.
A
FEW
MONTHS
OF
TRAINING
HAD
DONE
FOR
THAT
REALLY
FINE
CHAP.
HE
SQUINTED
AT
THE
STEAM-GAUGE
AND
AT
THE
WATER-GUAGE
WITH
AN
EVIDENT
EFFORT
OF
INTREPIDITY
--
AND
HE
HAD
FILED
TEETH,
TOO,
THE
POOR
DEVIL,
AND
THE
WOOL
OF
HIS
PATE
SHAVED
INTO
QUEER
PATTERNS,
AND
THREE
ORNA-
MENTAL
SCARS
ON
EACH
OF
HIS
CHEEKS.
HE
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
CLAPPING
HIS
HANDS
AND
STAMPING
HIS
FEET
ON
THE
BANK,
INSTEAD
OF
WHICH
HE
WAS
HARD
AT
WORK,
A
THRALL
TO
STRANGE
WITCHCRAFT,
FULL
OF
IMPROVING
KNOWLEDGE.
HE
WAS
USEFUL
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
BEEN
INSTRUCTED;
AND
WHAT
HE
KNEW
WAS
THIS
--
THAT
SHOULD
THE
WATER
IN
THAT
TRANS-
PARENT
THING
DISAPPEAR,
THE
EVIL
SPIRIT
INSIDE
THE
BOILER
WOULD
GET
ANGRY
THROUGH
THE
GREATNESS
OF
HIS
THIRST,
AND
TAKE
A
TERRIBLE
VENGEANCE.
SO
HE
SWEATED
AND
WATCHED
THE
GLASS
FEARFULLY
(WITH
AN
IMPROMPTU
CHARM,
MADE
OF
RAGS,
TIED
TO
HIS
ARM,
AND
A
PIECE
OF
POLISHED
BONE,
AS
BIG
AS
A
WATCH,
STUCK
FLATWAYS
THROUGH
HIS
LOWER
LIP),
WHILE
THE
WOODED
BANKS
SLIPPED
PAST
US
SLOWLY,
THE
SHORT
NOISE
WAS
LEFT
BEHIND,
THE
INTER-
MINABLE
MILES
OF
SILENCE
--
AND
WE
CREPT
ON,
TOWARDS
KURTZ.
BUT
THE
SNAGS
WERE
THICK,
THE
WATER
WAS
TREACH-
EROUS
AND
SHALLOW,
THE
BOILER
SEEMED
INDEED
TO
HAVE
A
SULKY
DEVIL
IN
IT,
AND
THUS
NEITHER
THAT
FIREMAN
NOR
I
HAD
ANY
TIME
TO
PEER
INTO
OUR
CREEPY
THOUGHTS.


"SOME
FIFTY
MILES
BELOW
THE
INNER
STATION
WE
CAME
UPON
A
HUT
OF
REEDS,
AN
INCLINED
AND
MELANCHOLY
POLE,
WITH
THE
UNRECOGNIZABLE
TATTERS
OF
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
A
FLAG
OF
SOME
SORT
FLYING
FROM
IT,
AND
A
NEATLY
STACKED
WOODPILE.
THIS
WAS
UNEXPECTED.
WE
CAME
TO
THE
BANK,
AND
ON
THE
STACK
OF
FIREWOOD
FOUND
A
FLAT
PIECE
OF
BOARD
WITH
SOME
FADED
PENCIL-WRITING
ON
IT.
WHEN
DE-
CIPHERED
IT
SAID:
'WOOD
FOR
YOU.
HURRY
UP.
APPROACH
CAUTIOUSLY.'
THERE
WAS
A
SIGNATURE,
BUT
IT
WAS
ILLEGIBLE
--
NOT
KURTZ
--
A
MUCH
LONGER
WORD.
'HURRY
UP.'
WHERE?
UP
THE
RIVER?
'APPROACH
CAUTIOUSLY.'
WE
HAD
NOT
DONE
SO.
BUT
THE
WARNING
COULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
MEANT
FOR
THE
PLACE
WHERE
IT
COULD
BE
ONLY
FOUND
AFTER
APPROACH.
SOMETHING
WAS
WRONG
ABOVE.
BUT
WHAT
--
AND
HOW
MUCH?
THAT
WAS
THE
QUESTION.
WE
COMMENTED
ADVERSELY
UPON
THE
IMBECILITY
OF
THAT
TELEGRAPHIC
STYLE.
THE
BUSH
AROUND
SAID
NOTHING,
AND
WOULD
NOT
LET
US
LOOK
VERY
FAR
EITHER.
A
TORN
CURTAIN
OF
RED
TWILL
HUNG
IN
THE
DOORWAY
OF
THE
HUT,
AND
FLAPPED
SADLY
IN
OUR
FACES.
THE
DWELLING
WAS
DIS-
MANTLED;
BUT
WE
COULD
SEE
A
WHITE
MAN
HAD
LIVED
THERE
NOT
VERY
LONG
AGO.
THERE
REMAINED
A
RUDE
TABLE
--
A
PLANK
ON
TWO
POSTS;
A
HEAP
OF
RUBBISH
REPOSED
IN
A
DARK
CORNER,
AND
BY
THE
DOOR
I
PICKED
UP
A
BOOK.
IT
HAD
LOST
ITS
COVERS,
AND
THE
PAGES
HAD
BEEN
THUMBED
INTO
A
STATE
OF
EXTREMELY
DIRTY
SOFTNESS;
BUT
THE
BACK
HAD
BEEN
LOVINGLY
STITCHED
AFRESH
WITH
WHITE
COTTON
THREAD,
WHICH
LOOKED
CLEAN
YET.
IT
WAS
AN
EXTRAORDI-
NARY
FIND.
ITS
TITLE
WAS,
AN
INQUIRY
INTO
SOME
POINTS
OF
SEAMANSHIP,
BY
A
MAN
TOWSER,
TOWSON
--
SOME
SUCH
NAME
--
MASTER
IN
HIS
MAJESTY'S
NAVY.
THE
MATTER
LOOKED
DREARY
READING
ENOUGH,
WITH
ILLUSTRATIVE
DIA-
GRAMS
AND
REPULSIVE
TABLES
OF
FIGURES,
AND
THE
COPY
WAS
SIXTY
YEARS
OLD.
I
HANDLED
THIS
AMAZING
ANTIQUITY
WITH
THE
GREATEST
POSSIBLE
TENDERNESS,
LEST
IT
SHOULD
DISSOLVE
IN
MY
HANDS.
WITHIN,
TOWSON
OR
TOWSER
WAS
INQUIRING
EARNESTLY
INTO
THE
BREAKING
STRAIN
OF
SHIPS'
CHAINS
AND
TACKLE,
AND
OTHER
SUCH
MATTERS.
NOT
A
VERY
ENTHRALLING
BOOK;
BUT
AT
THE
FIRST
GLANCE
YOU
COULD
SEE
THERE
A
SINGLENESS
OF
INTENTION,
AN
HONEST
CONCERN
FOR
THE
RIGHT
WAY
OF
GOING
TO
WORK,
WHICH
MADE
THESE
HUMBLE
PAGES,
THOUGHT
OUT
SO
MANY
YEARS
AGO,
LUMI-
NOUS
WITH
ANOTHER
THAN
A
PROFESSIONAL
LIGHT.
THE
SIMPLE
OLD
SAILOR,
WITH
HIS
TALK
OF
CHAINS
AND
PURCHASES,
MADE
ME
FORGET
THE
JUNGLE
AND
THE
PILGRIMS
IN
A
DELI-
CIOUS
SENSATION
OF
HAVING
COME
UPON
SOMETHING
UNMIS-
TAKABLY
REAL.
SUCH
A
BOOK
BEING
THERE
WAS
WONDERFUL
ENOUGH
BUT
STILL
MORE
ASTOUNDING
WERE
THE
NOTES
PEN-
CILLED
IN
THE
MARGIN,
AND
PLAINLY
REFERRING
TO
THE
TEXT.
I
COULDN'T
BELIEVE
MY
EYES!
THEY
WERE
IN
CIPHER!
YES,
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
CIPHER.
FANCY
A
MAN
LUGGING
WITH
HIM
A
BOOK
OF
THAT
DESCRIPTION
INTO
THIS
NOWHERE
AND
STUDYING
IT
--
AND
MAKING
NOTES
--
IN
CIPHER
AT
THAT!
IT
WAS
AN
EXTRAVAGANT
MYSTERY.


"I
HAD
BEEN
DIMLY
AWARE
FOR
SOME
TIME
OF
A
WORRY-
ING
NOISE,
AND
WHEN
I
LIFTED
MY
EYES
I
SAW
THE
WOOD-
PILE
WAS
GONE,
AND
THE
MANAGER,
AIDED
BY
ALL
THE
PIL-
GRIMS,
WAS
SHOUTING
AT
ME
FROM
THE
RIVERSIDE.
I
SLIPPED
THE
BOOK
INTO
MY
POCKET.
I
ASSURE
YOU
TO
LEAVE
OFF
READING
WAS
LIKE
TEARING
MYSELF
AWAY
FROM
THE
SHELTER
OF
AN
OLD
AND
SOLID
FRIENDSHIP.


"I
STARTED
THE
LAME
ENGINE
AHEAD.
'IT
MUST
BE
THIS
MISERABLE
TRADER
--
THIS
INTRUDER,'
EXCLAIMED
THE
MAN-
AGER,
LOOKING
BACK
MALEVOLENTLY
AT
THE
PLACE
WE
HAD
LEFT.
'HE
MUST
BE
ENGLISH,'
I
SAID.
'IT
WILL
NOT
SAVE
HIM
FROM
GETTING
INTO
TROUBLE
IF
HE
IS
NOT
CAREFUL,'
MUTTERED
THE
MANAGER
DARKLY.
I
OBSERVED
WITH
AS-
SUMED
INNOCENCE
THAT
NO
MAN
WAS
SAFE
FROM
TROUBLE
IN
THIS
WORLD.


"THE
CURRENT
WAS
MORE
RAPID
NOW,
THE
STEAMER
SEEMED
AT
HER
LAST
GASP,
THE
STERN-WHEEL
FLOPPED
LAN-
GUIDLY,
AND
I
CAUGHT
MYSELF
LISTENING
ON
TIPTOE
FOR
THE
NEXT
BEAT
OF
THE
BOAT,
FOR
IN
SOBER
TRUTH
I
EXPECTED
THE
WRETCHED
THING
TO
GIVE
UP
EVERY
MOMENT.
IT
WAS
LIKE
WATCHING
THE
LAST
FLICKERS
OF
A
LIFE.
BUT
STILL
WE
CRAWLED.
SOMETIMES
I
WOULD
PICK
OUT
A
TREE
A
LITTLE
WAY
AHEAD
TO
MEASURE
OUR
PROGRESS
TOWARDS
KURTZ
BY,
BUT
I
LOST
IT
INVARIABLY
BEFORE
WE
GOT
ABREAST.
TO
KEEP
THE
EYES
SO
LONG
ON
ONE
THING
WAS
TOO
MUCH
FOR
HUMAN
PATIENCE.
THE
MANAGER
DISPLAYED
A
BEAUTIFUL
RESIGNATION.
I
FRETTED
AND
FUMED
AND
TOOK
TO
ARGUING
WITH
MYSELF
WHETHER
OR
NO
I
WOULD
TALK
OPENLY
WITH
KURTZ;
BUT
BEFORE
I
COULD
COME
TO
ANY
CONCLUSION
IT
OCCURRED
TO
ME
THAT
MY
SPEECH
OR
MY
SILENCE,
INDEED
ANY
ACTION
OF
MINE,
WOULD
BE
A
MERE
FUTILITY.
WHAT
DID
IT
MATTER
WHAT
ANY
ONE
KNEW
OR
IGNORED?
WHAT
DID
IT
MATTER
WHO
WAS
MANAGER?
ONE
GETS
SOMETIMES
SUCH
A
FLASH
OF
INSIGHT.
THE
ESSENTIALS
OF
THIS
AFFAIR
LAY
DEEP
UNDER
THE
SURFACE,
BEYOND
MY
REACH,
AND
BEYOND
MY
POWER
OF
MEDDLING.


"TOWARDS
THE
EVENING
OF
THE
SECOND
DAY
WE
JUDGED
OURSELVES
ABOUT
EIGHT
MILES
FROM
KURTZ'S
STATION.
I
WANTED
TO
PUSH
ON;
BUT
THE
MANAGER
LOOKED
GRAVE,
AND
TOLD
ME
THE
NAVIGATION
UP
THERE
WAS
SO
DANGEROUS
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
ADVISABLE,
THE
SUN
BEING
VERY
LOW
ALREADY,
TO
WAIT
WHERE
WE
WERE
TILL
NEXT
MORNING.
MOREOVER,
HE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
IF
THE
WARNING
TO
AP-
PROACH
CAUTIOUSLY
WERE
TO
BE
FOLLOWED,
WE
MUST
AP-
PROACH
IN
DAYLIGHT
--
NOT
AT
DUSK
OR
IN
THE
DARK.
THIS
WAS
SENSIBLE
ENOUGH.
EIGHT
MILES
MEANT
NEARLY
THREE
HOURS'
STEAMING
FOR
US,
AND
I
COULD
ALSO
SEE
SUSPICIOUS
RIPPLES
AT
THE
UPPER
END
OF
THE
REACH.
NEVERTHELESS,
I
WAS
ANNOYED
BEYOND
EXPRESSION
AT
THE
DELAY,
AND
MOST
UNREASONABLY,
TOO,
SINCE
ONE
NIGHT
MORE
COULD
NOT
MATTER
MUCH
AFTER
SO
MANY
MONTHS.
AS
WE
HAD
PLENTY
OF
WOOD,
AND
CAUTION
WAS
THE
WORD,
I
BROUGHT
UP
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
STREAM.
THE
REACH
WAS
NARROW,
STRAIGHT,
WITH
HIGH
SIDES
LIKE
A
RAILWAY
CUTTING.
THE
DUSK
CAME
GLIDING
INTO
IT
LONG
BEFORE
THE
SUN
HAD
SET.
THE
CURRENT
RAN
SMOOTH
AND
SWIFT,
BUT
A
DUMB
IMMO-
BILITY
SAT
ON
THE
BANKS.
THE
LIVING
TREES,
LASHED
TO-
GETHER
BY
THE
CREEPERS
AND
EVERY
LIVING
BUSH
OF
THE
UNDERGROWTH,
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
CHANGED
INTO
STONE,
EVEN
TO
THE
SLENDEREST
TWIG,
TO
THE
LIGHTEST
LEAF.
IT
WAS
NOT
SLEEP
--
IT
SEEMED
UNNATURAL,
LIKE
A
STATE
OF
TRANCE.
NOT
THE
FAINTEST
SOUND
OF
ANY
KIND
COULD
BE
HEARD.
YOU
LOOKED
ON
AMAZED,
AND
BEGAN
TO
SUSPECT
YOURSELF
OF
BEING
DEAF--
THEN
THE
NIGHT
CAME
SUD-
DENLY,
AND
STRUCK
YOU
BLIND
AS
WELL.
ABOUT
THREE
IN
THE
MORNING
SOME
LARGE
FISH
LEAPED,
AND
THE
LOUD
SPLASH
MADE
ME
JUMP
AS
THOUGH
A
GUN
HAD
BEEN
FIRED.
WHEN
THE
SUN
ROSE
THERE
WAS
A
WHITE
FOG,
VERY
WARM
AND
CLAMMY,
AND
MORE
BLINDING
THAN
THE
NIGHT.
IT
DID
NOT
SHIFT
OR
DRIVE;
IT
WAS
JUST
THERE,
STANDING
ALL
ROUND
YOU
LIKE
SOMETHING
SOLID.
AT
EIGHT
OR
NINE,
PERHAPS,
IT
LIFTED
AS
A
SHUTTER
LIFTS.
WE
HAD
A
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
TOWERING
MULTITUDE
OF
TREES,
OF
THE
IMMENSE
MATTED
JUNGLE,
WITH
THE
BLAZING
LITTLE
BALL
OF
THE
SUN
HANGING
OVER
IT
--
ALL
PERFECTLY
STILL
--
AND
THEN
THE
WHITE
SHUTTER
CAME
DOWN
AGAIN,
SMOOTHLY,
AS
IF
SLIDING
IN
GREASED
GROOVES.
I
ORDERED
THE
CHAIN,
WHICH
WE
HAD
BEGUN
TO
HEAVE
IN,
TO
BE
PAID
OUT
AGAIN.
BEFORE
IT
STOPPED
RUN-
NING
WITH
A
MUFFLED
RATTLE,
A
CRY,
A
VERY
LOUD
CRY,
AS
OF
INFINITE
DESOLATION,
SOARED
SLOWLY
IN
THE
OPAQUE
AIR.
IT
CEASED.
A
COMPLAINING
CLAMOUR,
MODULATED
IN
SAVAGE
DISCORDS,
FILLED
OUR
EARS.
THE
SHEER
UNEXPECTEDNESS
OF
IT
MADE
MY
HAIR
STIR
UNDER
MY
CAP.
I
DON'T
KNOW
HOW
IT
STRUCK
THE
OTHERS:
TO
ME
IT
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
THE
MIST
ITSELF
HAD
SCREAMED,
SO
SUDDENLY,
AND
APPARENTLY
FROM
ALL
SIDES
AT
ONCE,
DID
THIS
TUMULTUOUS
AND
MOURN-
FUL
UPROAR
ARISE.
IT
CULMINATED
IN
A
HURRIED
OUTBREAK
OF
ALMOST
INTOLERABLY
ESCESSIVE
SHRIEKING,
WHICH
STOPPED
SHORT,
LEAVING
US
STIFFENED
IN
A
VARIETY
OF
SILLY
ATTITUDES,
AND
OBSTINATELY
LISTENING
TO
THE
NEARLY
AS
APPALLING
AND
EXCESSIVE
SILENCE.
'GOOD
GOD!
WHAT
IS
THE
MEANING
--'
STAMMERED
AT
MY
ELBOW
ONE
OF
THE
PILGRIMS
--
A
LITTLE
FAT
MAN,
WITH
SANDY
HAIR
AND
RED
WHISKERS,
WHO
WORE
SIDESPRING
BOOTS,
AND
PINK
PY-
JAMAS
TUCKED
INTO
HIS
SOCKS.
TWO
OTHERS
REMAINED
OPEN-MOUTHED
A
WHOLE
MINUTE,
THEN
DASHED
INTO
THE
LITTLE
CABIN,
TO
RUSH
OUT
INCONTINENTLY
AND
STAND
DART-
ING
SCARED
GLANCES,
WITH
WINCHESTERS
AT
'READY'
IN
THEIR
HANDS.
WHAT
WE
COULD
SEE
WAS
JUST
THE
STEAMER
WE
WERE
ON,
HER
OUTLINES
BLURRED
AS
THOUGH
SHE
HAD
BEEN
ON
THE
POINT
OF
DISSOLVING,
AND
A
MISTY
STRIP
OF
WATER,
PERHAPS
TWO
FEET
BROAD,
AROUND
HER
--
AND
THAT
WAS
ALL.
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
WAS
NOWHERE,
AS
FAR
AS
OUR
EYES
AND
EARS
WERE
CONCERNED.
JUST
NOWHERE.
GONE,
DISAPPEARED;
SWEPT
OFF
WITHOUT
LEAVING
A
WHISPER
OR
A
SHADOW
BEHIND.


"I
WENT
FORWARD,
AND
ORDERED
THE
CHAIN
TO
BE
HAULED
IN
SHORT,
SO
AS
TO
BE
READY
TO
TRIP
THE
ANCHOR
AND
MOVE
THE
STEAMBOAT
AT
ONCE
IF
NECESSARY.
'WILL
THEY
ATTACK?'
WHISPERED
AN
AWED
VOICE.
'WE
WILL
BE
ALL
BUTCHERED
IN
THIS
FOG,'
MURMURED
ANOTHER.
THE
FACES
TWITCHED
WITH
THE
STRAIN,
THE
HANDS
TREMBLED
SLIGHTLY,
THE
EYES
FORGOT
TO
WINK.
IT
WAS
VERY
CURIOUS
TO
SEE
THE
CONTRAST
OF
EXPRESSIONS
OF
THE
WHITE
MEN
AND
OF
THE
BLACK
FELLOWS
OF
OUR
CREW,
WHO
WERE
AS
MUCH
STRANGERS
TO
THAT
PART
OF
THE
RIVER
AS
WE,
THOUGH
THEIR
HOMES
WERE
ONLY
EIGHT
HUNDRED
MILES
AWAY.
THE
WHITES,
OF
COURSE
GREATLY
DISCOMPOSED,
HAD
BE-
SIDES
A
CURIOUS
LOOK
OF
BEING
PAINFULLY
SHOCKED
BY
SUCH
AN
OUTRAGEOUS
ROW.
THE
OTHERS
HAD
AN
ALERT,
NATURALLY
INTERESTED
EXPRESSION;
BUT
THEIR
FACES
WERE
ESSENTIALLY
QUIET,
EVEN
THOSE
OF
THE
ONE
OR
TWO
WHO
GRINNED
AS
THEY
HAULED
AT
THE
CHAIN.
SEVERAL
EXCHANGED
SHORT,
GRUNTING
PHRASES,
WHICH
SEEMED
TO
SETTLE
THE
MATTER
TO
THEIR
SATISFACTION.
THEIR
HEADMAN,
A
YOUNG,
BROAD-
CHESTED
BLACK,
SEVERELY
DRAPED
IN
DARKBLUE
FRINGED
CLOTHS,
WITH
FIERCE
NOSTRILS
AND
HIS
HAIR
ALL
DONE
UP
ARTFULLY
IN
OILY
RINGLETS,
STOOD
NEAR
ME.
'AHA!'
I
SAID,
JUST
FOR
GOOD
FELLOWSHIP'S
SAKE.
'CATCH
'IM,'
HE
SNAPPED,
WITH
A
BLOODSHOT
WIDENING
OF
HIS
EYES
AND
A
FLASH
OF
SHARP
TEETH
--
'CATCH
'IM.
GIVE
'IM
TO
US."TO
YOU,
EH?'
I
ASKED;
'WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
WITH
THEM?'
'EAT
'IM!'
HE
SAID
CURTLY,
AND,
LEANING
HIS
ELBOW
ON
THE
RAIL,
LOOKED
OUT
INTO
THE
FOG
IN
A
DIGNIFIED
AND
PRO-
FOUNDLY
PENSIVE
ATTITUDE.
I
WOULD
NO
DOUBT
HAVE
BEEN
PROPERLY
HORRIFIED,
HAD
IT
NOT
OCCURRED
TO
ME
THAT
HE
AND
HIS
CHAPS
MUST
BE
VERY
HUNGRY:
THAT
THEY
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
GROWING
INCREASINGLY
HUNGRY
FOR
AT
LEAST
THIS
MONTH
PAST.
THEY
HAD
BEEN
ENGAGED
FOR
SIX
MONTHS
(I
DON'T
THINK
A
SINGLE
ONE
OF
THEM
HAD
ANY
CLEAR
IDEA
OF
TIME,
AS
WE
AT
THE
END
OF
COUNTLESS
AGES
HAVE.
THEY
STILL
BELONGED
TO
THE
BEGINNINGS
OF
TIME
--
HAD
NO
INHERITED
EXPERIENCE
TO
TEACH
THEM
AS
IT
WERE),
AND
OF
COURSE,
AS
LONG
AS
THERE
WAS
A
PIECE
OF
PAPER
WRITTEN
OVER
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
SOME
FARCICAL
LAW
OR
OTHER
MADE
DOWN
THE
RIVER,
IT
DIDN'T
ENTER
ANYBODY'S
HEAD
TO
TROUBLE
HOW
THEY
WOULD
LIVE.
CERTAINLY
THEY
HAD
BROUGHT
WITH
THEM
SOME
ROTTEN
HIPPO-MEAT,
WHICH
COULDN'T
HAVE
LASTED
VERY
LONG,
ANYWAY,
EVEN
IF
THE
PILGRIMS
HADN'T,
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
A
SHOCKING
HULLABALOO,
THROWN
A
CONSIDERABLE
QUANTITY
OF
IT
OVERBOARD.
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
HIGH-HANDED
PROCEEDING;
BUT
IT
WAS
REALLY
A
CASE
OF
LEGITIMATE
SELF-DEFENCE.
YOU
CAN'T
BREATHE
DEAD
HIPPO
WAKING,
SLEEPING,
AND
EATING,
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
KEEP
YOUR
PRECARIOUS
GRIP
ON
EXIST-
ENCE.
BESIDES
THAT,
THEY
HAD
GIVEN
THEM
EVERY
WEEK
THREE
PIECES
OF
BRASS
WIRE,
EACH
ABOUT
NINE
INCHES
LONG;
AND
THE
THEORY
WAS
THEY
WERE
TO
BUY
THEIR
PROVISIONS
WITH
THAT
CURRENCY
IN
RIVERSIDE
VILLAGES.
YOU
CAN
SEE
HOW
THAT
WORKED.
THERE
WERE
EITHER
NO
VILLAGES,
OR
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
HOSTILE,
OR
THE
DIRECTOR,
WHO
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
US
FED
OUT
OF
TINS,
WITH
AN
OCCASIONAL
OLD
HE-GOAT
THROWN
IN,
DIDN'T
WANT
TO
STOP
THE
STEAMER
FOR
SOME
MORE
OR
LESS
RECONDITE
REASON.
SO,
UNLESS
THEY
SWAL-
LOWED
THE
WIRE
ITSELF,
OR
MADE
LOOPS
OF
IT
TO
SNARE
THE
FISHES
WITH,
I
DON'T
SEE
WHAT
GOOD
THEIR
EXTRAVAGANT
SALARY
COULD
BE
TO
THEM.
I
MUST
SAY
IT
WAS
PAID
WITH
A
REGULARITY
WORTHY
OF
A
LARGE
AND
HONOURABLE
TRADING
COMPANY.
FOR
THE
REST,
THE
ONLY
THING
TO
EAT
--
THOUGH
IT
DIDN'T
LOOK
EATABLE
IN
THE
LEAST
--
I
SAW
IN
THEIR
POS-
SESSION
WAS
A
FEW
LUMPS
OF
SOME
STUFF
LIKE
HALF-COOKED
DOUGH,
OF
A
DIRTY
LAVENDER
COLOUR,
THEY
KEPT
WRAPPED
IN
LEAVES,
AND
NOW
AND
THEN
SWALLOWED
A
PIECE
OF,
BUT
SO
SMALL
THAT
IT
SEEMED
DONE
MORE
FOR
THE
LOOKS
OF
THE
THING
THAN
FOR
ANY
SERIOUS
PURPOSE
OF
SUSTENANCE.
WHY
IN
THE
NAME
OF
ALL
THE
GNAWING
DEVILS
OF
HUNGER
THEY
DIDN'T
GO
FOR
US
--
THEY
WERE
THIRTY
TO
FIVE
--
AND
HAVE
A
GOOD
TUCK-IN
FOR
ONCE,
AMAZES
ME
NOW
WHEN
I
THINK
OF
IT.
THEY
WERE
BIG
POWERFUL
MEN,
WITH
NOT
MUCH
CAPACITY
TO
WEIGH
THE
CONSEQUENCES,
WITH
COUR-
AGE,
WITH
STRENGTH,
EVEN
YET,
THOUGH
THEIR
SKINS
WERE
NO
LONGER
GLOSSY
AND
THEIR
MUSCLES
NO
LONGER
HARD.
AND
I
SAW
THAT
SOMETHING
RESTRAINING,
ONE
OF
THOSE
HUMAN
SECRETS
THAT
BAFFLE
PROBABILITY,
HAD
COME
INTO
PLAY
THERE.
I
LOOKED
AT
THEM
WITH
A
SWIFT
QUICKENING
OF
INTEREST
--
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
OCCURRED
TO
ME
I
MIGHT
BE
EATEN
BY
THEM
BEFORE
VERY
LONG,
THOUGH
I
OWN
TO
YOU
THAT
JUST
THEN
I
PERCEIVED
--
IN
A
NEW
LIGHT,
AS
IT
WERE
--
HOW
UNWHOLESOME
THE
PILGRIMS
LOOKED,
AND
I
HOPED,
YES,
I
POSITIVELY
HOPED,
THAT
MY
ASPECT
WAS
NOT
SO
--
WHAT
SHALL
I
SAY?
--
SO
--
UNAPPETIZING:
A
TOUCH
OF
FANTASTIC
VANITY
WHICH
FITTED
WELL
WITH
THE
DREAM-SEN-
SATION
THAT
PERVADED
ALL
MY
DAYS
AT
THAT
TIME.
PERHAPS
I
HAD
A
LITTLE
FEVER,
TOO.
ONE
CAN'T
LIVE
WITH
ONE'S
FINGER
EVERLASTINGLY
ON
ONE'S
PULSE.
I
HAD
OFTEN
'A
LITTLE
FEVER,'
OR
A
LITTLE
TOUCH
OF
OTHER
THINGS
--
THE
PLAYFUL
PAW-STROKES
OF
THE
WILDERNESS,
THE
PRELIMINARY
TRIFLING
BEFORE
THE
MORE
SERIOUS
ONSLAUGHT
WHICH
CAME
IN
DUE
COURSE.
YES;
I
LOOKED
AT
THEM
AS
YOU
WOULD
ON
ANY
HUMAN
BEING,
WITH
A
CURIOSITY
OF
THEIR
IMPULSES,
MOTIVES,
CAPACITIES,
WEAKNESSES,
WHEN
BROUGHT
TO
THE
TEST
OF
AN
INEXORABLE
PHYSICAL
NECESSITY.
RESTRAINT!
WHAT
POSSIBLE
RESTRAINT?
WAS
IT
SUPERSTITION,
DISGUST,
PATIENCE,
FEAR
--
OR
SOME
KIND
OF
PRIMITIVE
HONOUR?
NO
FEAR
CAN
STAND
UP
TO
HUNGER,
NO
PATIENCE
CAN
WEAR
IT
OUT,
DISGUST
SIMPLY
DOES
NOT
EXIST
WHERE
HUNGER
IS;
AND
AS
TO
SUPERSTITION,
BELIEFS,
AND
WHAT
YOU
MAY
CALL
PRINCI-
PLES,
THEY
ARE
LESS
THAN
CHAFF
IN
A
BREEZE.
DON'T
YOU
KNOW
THE
DEVILRY
OF
LINGERING
STARVATION,
ITS
EXASPERAT-
ING
TORMENT,
ITS
BLACK
THOUGHTS,
ITS
SOMBRE
AND
BROOD-
ING
FEROCITY?
WELL,
I
DO.
IT
TAKES
A
MAN
ALL
HIS
INBORN
STRENGTH
TO
FIGHT
HUNGER
PROPERLY.
IT'S
REALLY
EASIER
TO
FACE
BEREAVEMENT,
DISHONOUR,
AND
THE
PERDITION
OF
ONE'S
SOUL
--
THAN
THIS
KIND
OF
PROLONGED
HUNGER.
SAD,
BUT
TRUE.
AND
THESE
CHAPS,
TOO,
HAD
NO
EARTHLY
REASON
FOR
ANY
KIND
OF
SCRUPLE.
RESTRAINT!
I
WOULD
JUST
AS
SOON
HAVE
EXPECTED
RESTRAINT
FROM
A
HYENA
PROWLING
AMONGST
THE
CORPSES
OF
A
BATTLEFIELD.
BUT
THERE
WAS
THE
FACT
FACING
ME
--
THE
FACT
DAZZLING,
TO
BE
SEEN,
LIKE
THE
FOAM
ON
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
SEA,
LIKE
A
RIPPLE
ON
AN
UN-
FATHOMABLE
ENIGMA,
A
MYSTERY
GREATER
--
WHEN
I
THOUGHT
OF
IT
--
THAN
THE
CURIOUS,
INEXPLICABLE
NOTE
OF
DESPERATE
GRIEF
IN
THIS
SAVAGE
CLAMOUR
THAT
HAD
SWEPT
BY
US
ON
THE
RIVER-BANK,
BEHIND
THE
BLIND
WHITENESS
OF
THE
FOG.


"TWO
PILGRIMS
WERE
QUARRELLING
IN
HURRIED
WHIS-
PERS
AS
TO
WHICH
BANK.
'LEFT.'
'NO,
NO;
HOW
CAN
YOU?
RIGHT,
RIGHT,
OF
COURSE.'
'IT
IS
VERY
SERIOUS,'
SAID
THE
MANAGER'S
VOICE
BEHIND
ME;
'I
WOULD
BE
DESOLATED
IF
ANYTHING
SHOULD
HAPPEN
TO
MR.
KURTZ
BEFORE
WE
CAME
UP.'
I
LOOKED
AT
HIM,
AND
HAD
NOT
THE
SLIGHTEST
DOUBT
HE
WAS
SINCERE.
HE
WAS
JUST
THE
KIND
OF
MAN
WHO
WOULD
WISH
TO
PRESERVE
APPEARANCES.
THAT
WAS
HIS
RE-
STRAINT.
BUT
WHEN
HE
MUTTERED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
GOING
ON
AT
ONCE,
I
DID
NOT
EVEN
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
ANSWER
HIM.
I
KNEW,
AND
HE
KNEW,
THAT
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE.
WERE
WE
TO
LET
GO
OUR
HOLD
OF
THE
BOTTOM,
WE
WOULD
BE
ABSOLUTELY
IN
THE
AIR
--
IN
SPACE.
WE
WOULDN'T
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
WHERE
WE
WERE
GOING
TO
--
WHETHER
UP
OR
DOWN
STREAM,
OR
ACROSS
--
TILL
WE
FETCHED
AGAINST
ONE
BANK
OR
THE
OTHER
--
AND
THEN
WE
WOULDN'T
KNOW
AT
FIRST
WHICH
IT
WAS.
OF
COURSE
I
MADE
NO
MOVE.
I
HAD
NO
MIND
FOR
A
SMASH-UP.
YOU
COULDN'T
IMAGINE
A
MORE
DEADLY
PLACE
FOR
A
SHIPWRECK.
WHETHER
DROWNED
AT
ONCE
OR
NOT,
WE
WERE
SURE
TO
PERISH
SPEEDILY
IN
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER.
'I
AUTHORIZE
YOU
TO
TAKE
ALL
THE
RISKS,'
HE
SAID,
AFTER
A
SHORT
SILENCE.
'I
REFUSE
TO
TAKE
ANY,'
I
SAID
SHORTLY;
WHICH
WAS
JUST
THE
ANSWER
HE
EXPECTED,
THOUGH
ITS
TONE
MIGHT
HAVE
SURPRISED
HIM.
'WELL,
I
MUST
DEFER
TO
YOUR
JUDGMENT.
YOU
ARE
CAPTAIN,'
HE
SAID
WITH
MARKED
CIVILITY.
I
TURNED
MY
SHOULDER
TO
HIM
IN
SIGN
OF
MY
APPRECIATION,
AND
LOOKED
INTO
THE
FOG.
HOW
LONG
WOULD
IT
LAST?
IT
WAS
THE
MOST
HOPELESS
LOOKOUT.
THE
APPROACH
TO
THIS
KURTZ
GRUBBING
FOR
IVORY
IN
THE
WRETCHED
BUSH
WAS
BESET
BY
AS
MANY
DAN-
GERS
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
BEEN
AN
ENCHANTED
PRINCESS
SLEEPING
IN
A
FABULOUS
CASTLE.
'WILL
THEY
ATTACK,
DO
YOU
THINK?'
ASKED
THE
MANAGER,
IN
A
CONFIDENTIAL
TONE.


"I
DID
NOT
THINK
THEY
WOULD
ATTACK,
FOR
SEVERAL
OBVIOUS
REASONS.
THE
THICK
FOG
WAS
ONE.
IF
THEY
LEFT
THE
BANK
IN
THEIR
CANOES
THEY
WOULD
GET
LOST
IN
IT,
AS
WE
WOULD
BE
IF
WE
ATTEMPTED
TO
MOVE.
STILL,
I
HAD
ALSO
JUDGED
THE
JUNGLE
OF
BOTH
BANKS
QUITE
IMPENE-
TRABLE
--
AND
YET
EYES
WERE
IN
IT,
EYES
THAT
HAD
SEEN
US.
THE
RIVERSIDE
BUSHES
WERE
CERTAINLY
VERY
THICK;
BUT
THE
UNDERGROWTH
BEHIND
WAS
EVIDENTLY
PENETRABLE.
HOWEVER,
DURING
THE
SHORT
LIFT
I
HAD
SEEN
NO
CANOES
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
REACH
--
CERTAINLY
NOT
ABREAST
OF
THE
STEAMER.
BUT
WHAT
MADE
THE
IDEA
OF
ATTACK
INCONCEIV-
ABLE
TO
ME
WAS
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
NOISE
--
OF
THE
CRIES
WE
HAD
HEARD.
THEY
HAD
NOT
THE
FIERCE
CHARACTER
BODING
IMMEDIATE
HOSTILE
INTENTION.
UNEXPECTED,
WILD,
AND
VIOLENT
AS
THEY
HAD
BEEN,
THEY
HAD
GIVEN
ME
AN
IRRESISTIBLE
IMPRESSION
OF
SORROW.
THE
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
STEAMBOAT
HAD
FOR
SOME
REASON
FILLED
THOSE
SAVAGES
WITH
UNRESTRAINED
GRIEF.
THE
DANGER,
IF
ANY,
I
EXPOUNDED,
WAS
FROM
OUR
PROXIMITY
TO
A
GREAT
HUMAN
PASSION
LET
LOOSE.
EVEN
EXTREME
GRIEF
MAY
UL-
TIMATELY
VENT
ITSELF
IN
VIOLENCE
--
BUT
MORE
GENERALLY
TAKES
THE
FORM
OF
APATHY....


"YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
SEEN
THE
PILGRIMS
STARE!
THEY
HAD
NO
HEART
TO
GRIN,
OR
EVEN
TO
REVILE
ME:
BUT
I
BE-
LIEVE
THEY
THOUGHT
ME
GONE
MAD
--
WITH
FRIGHT,
MAYBE.
I
DELIVERED
A
REGULAR
LECTURE.
MY
DEAR
BOYS,
IT
WAS
NO
GOOD
BOTHERING.
KEEP
A
LOOKOUT?
WELL,
YOU
MAY
GUESS
I
WATCHED
THE
FOG
FOR
THE
SIGNS
OF
LIFTING
AS
A
CAT
WATCHES
A
MOUSE;
BUT
FOR
ANYTHING
ELSE
OUR
EYES
WERE
OF
NO
MORE
USE
TO
US
THAN
IF
WE
HAD
BEEN
BURIED
MILES
DEEP
IN
A
HEAP
OF
COTTON-WOOL.
IT
FEIT
LIKE
IT,
TOO
--
CHOKING,
WARM,
STIFLING.
BESIDES,
ALL
I
SAID,
THOUGH
IT
SOUNDED
EXTRAVAGANT,
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
TO
FACT.
WHAT
WE
AFTERWARDS
ALLUDED
TO
AS
AN
ATTACK
WAS
REALLY
AN
ATTEMPT
AT
REPULSE.
THE
ACTION
WAS
VERY
FAR
FROM
BEING
AGGRESSIVE
--
IT
WAS
NOT
EVEN
DEFENSIVE,
IN
THE
USUAL
SENSE:
IT
WAS
UNDERTAKEN
UNDER
THE
STRESS
OF
DESPERATION,
AND
IN
ITS
ESSENCE
WAS
PURELY
PROTECTIVE.


"IT
DEVELOPED
ITSELF,
I
SHOULD
SAY,
TWO
HOURS
AFTER
THE
FOG
LIFTED,
AND
ITS
COMMENCEMENT
WAS
AT
A
SPOT,
ROUGHLY
SPEAKING,
ABOUT
A
MILE
AND
A
HALF
BELOW
KURTZ'S
STATION.
WE
HAD
JUST
FLOUNDERED
AND
FLOPPED
ROUND
A
BEND,
WHEN
I
SAW
AN
ISLET,
A
MERE
GRASSY
HUM-
MOCK
OF
BRIGHT
GREEN,
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
STREAM.
IT
WAS
THE
ONLY
THING
OF
THE
KIND;
BUT
AS
WE
OPENED
THE
REACH
MORE,
I
PERCEIVED
IT
WAS
THE
HEAD
OF
A
LONG
SAND-BANK,
OR
RATHER
OF
A
CHAIN
OF
SHALLOW
PATCHES
STRETCHING
DOWN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
RIVER.
THEY
WERE
DISCOLOURED,
JUST
AWASH,
AND
THE
WHOLE
LOT
WAS
SEEN
JUST
UNDER
THE
WATER,
EXACTLY
AS
A
MAN'S
BACKBONE
IS
SEEN
RUNNING
DOWN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
HIS
BACK
UNDER
THE
SKIN.
NOW,
AS
FAR
AS
I
DID
SEE,
I
COULD
GO
TO
THE
RIGHT
OR
TO
THE
LEFT
OF
THIS.
I
DIDN'T
KNOW
EITHER
CHANNEL,
OF
COURSE.
THE
BANKS
LOOKED
PRETTY
WELL
ALIKE,
THE
DEPTH
APPEARED
THE
SAME;
BUT
AS
I
HAD
BEEN
INFORMED
THE
STATION
WAS
ON
THE
WEST
SIDE,
I
NATURALLY
HEADED
FOR
THE
WESTERN
PASSAGE.


"NO
SOONER
HAD
WE
FAIRLY
ENTERED
IT
THAN
I
BECAME
AWARE
IT
WAS
MUCH
NARROWER
THAN
I
HAD
SUPPOSED.
TO
THE
LEFT
OF
US
THERE
WAS
THE
LONG
UNINTERRUPTED
SHOAL,
AND
TO
THE
RIGHT
A
HIGH,
STEEP
BANK
HEAVILY
OVERGROWN
WITH
BUSHES.
ABOVE
THE
BUSH
THE
TREES
STOOD
IN
SERRIED
RANKS.
THE
TWIGS
OVERHUNG
THE
CURRENT
THICKLY,
AND
FROM
DISTANCE
TO
DISTANCE
A
LARGE
LIMB
OF
SOME
TREE
PROJECTED
RIGIDLY
OVER
THE
STREAM.
IT
WAS
THEN
WELL
ON
IN
THE
AFTERNOON,
THE
FACE
OF
THE
FOREST
WAS
GLOOMY,
AND
A
BROAD
STRIP
OF
SHADOW
HAD
ALREADY
FALLEN
ON
THE
WATER.
IN
THIS
SHADOW
WE
STEAMED
UP
--
VERY
SLOWLY,
AS
YOU
MAY
IMAGINE.
I
SHEERED
HER
WELL
INSHORE
--
THE
WATER
BEING
DEEPEST
NEAR
THE
BANK,
AS
THE
SOUNDING-
POLE
INFORMED
ME.


"ONE
OF
MY
HUNGRY
AND
FORBEARING
FRIENDS
WAS
SOUNDING
IN
THE
BOWS
JUST
BELOW
ME.
THIS
STEAMBOAT
WAS
EXACTLY
LIKE
A
DECKED
SCOW.
ON
THE
DECK,
THERE
WERE
TWO
LITTLE
TEAKWOOD
HOUSES,
WITH
DOORS
AND
WIN-
DOWS.
THE
BOILER
WAS
IN
THE
FORE-END,
AND
THE
MA-
CHINERY
RIGHT
ASTERN.
OVER
THE
WHOLE
THERE
WAS
A
LIGHT
ROOF,
SUPPORTED
ON
STANCHIONS.
THE
FUNNEL
PROJECTED
THROUGH
THAT
ROOF,
AND
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
FUNNEL
A
SMALL
CABIN
BUILT
OF
LIGHT
PLANKS
SERVED
FOR
A
PILOT-HOUSE.
IT
CONTAINED
A
COUCH,
TWO
CAMP-STOOLS,
A
LOADED
MARTINI-
HENRY
LEANING
IN
ONE
CORNER,
A
TINY
TABLE,
AND
THE
STEERING-WHEEL.
IT
HAD
A
WIDE
DOOR
IN
FRONT
AND
A
BROAD
SHUTTER
AT
EACH
SIDE.
ALL
THESE
WERE
ALWAYS
THROWN
OPEN,
OF
COURSE.
I
SPENT
MY
DAYS
PERCHED
UP
THERE
ON
THE
EXTREME
FORE-END
OF
THAT
ROOF,
BEFORE
THE
DOOR.
AT
NIGHT
I
SLEPT,
OR
TRIED
TO,
ON
THE
COUCH.
AN
ATHLETIC
BLACK
BELONGING
TO
SOME
COAST
TRIBE
AND
EDU-
CATED
BY
MY
POOR
PREDECESSOR,
WAS
THE
HELMSMAN.
HE
SPORTED
A
PAIR
OF
BRASS
EARRINGS,
WORE
A
BLUE
CLOTH
WRAPPER
FROM
THE
WAIST
TO
THE
ANKLES,
AND
THOUGHT
ALL
THE
WORLD
OF
HIMSELF.
HE
WAS
THE
MOST
UNSTABLE
KIND
OF
FOOL
I
HAD
EVER
SEEN.
HE
STEERED
WITH
NO
END
OF
A
SWAGGER
WHILE
YOU
WERE
BY;
BUT
IF
HE
LOST
SIGHT
OF
YOU,
HE
BECAME
INSTANTLY
THE
PREY
OF
AN
ABJECT
FUNK,
AND
WOULD
LET
THAT
CRIPPLE
OF
A
STEAMBOAT
GET
THE
UPPER
HAND
OF
HIM
IN
A
MINUTE.


"I
WAS
LOOKING
DOWN
AT
THE
SOUNDING-POLE,
AND
FEELING
MUCH
ANNOYED
TO
SEE
AT
EACH
TRY
A
LITTLE
MORE
OF
IT
STICK
OUT
OF
THAT
RIVER,
WHEN
I
SAW
MY
POLEMAN
GIVE
UP
THE
BUSINESS
SUDDENLY,
AND
STRETCH
HIMSELF
FLAT
ON
THE
DECK,
WITHOUT
EVEN
TAKING
THE
TROUBLE
TO
HAUL
HIS
POLE
IN.
HE
KEPT
HOLD
ON
IT
THOUGH,
AND
IT
TRAILED
IN
THE
WATER.
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
FIREMAN,
WHOM
I
COULD
ALSO
SEE
BELOW
ME,
SAT
DOWN
ABRUPTLY
BEFORE
HIS
FURNACE
AND
DUCKED
HIS
HEAD.
I
WAS
AMAZED.
THEN
I
HAD
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
RIVER
MIGHTY
QUICK,
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
A
SNAG
IN
THE
FAIRWAY.
STICKS,
LITTLE
STICKS,
WERE
FLYING
ABOUT
--
THICK:
THEY
WERE
WHIZZING
BEFORE
MY
NOSE,
DROPPING
BELOW
ME,
STRIKING
BEHIND
ME
AGAINST
MY
PILOT-HOUSE.
ALL
THIS
TIME
THE
RIVER,
THE
SHORE,
THE
WOODS,
WERE
VERY
QUIET
--
PERFECTLY
QUIET.
I
COULD
ONLY
HEAR
THE
HEAVY
SPLASHING
THUMP
OF
THE
STERN-WHEEL
AND
THE
PATTER
OF
THESE
THINGS.
WE
CLEARED
THE
SNAG
CLUMSILY.
ARROWS,
BY
JOVE!
WE
WERE
BEING
SHOT
AT!
I
STEPPED
IN
QUICKLY
TO
CLOSE
THE
SHUTTER
ON
THE
LAND-
SIDE.
THAT
FOOL-HELMSMAN,
HIS
HANDS
ON
THE
SPOKES,
WAS
LIFTING
HIS
KNEES
HIGH,
STAMPING
HIS
FEET,
CHAMPING
HIS
MOUTH,
LIKE
A
REINED-IN
HORSE.
CONFOUND
HIM!
AND
WE
WERE
STAGGERING
WITHIN
TEN
FEET
OF
THE
BANK.
I
HAD
TO
LEAN
RIGHT
OUT
TO
SWING
THE
HEAVY
SHUTTER,
AND
I
SAW
A
FACE
AMONGST
THE
LEAVES
ON
THE
LEVEL
WITH
MY
OWN,
LOOKING
AT
ME
VERY
FIERCE
AND
STEADY;
AND
THEN
SUDDENLY,
AS
THOUGH
A
VEIL
HAD
BEEN
REMOVED
FROM
MY
EYES,
I
MADE
OUT,
DEEP
IN
THE
TANGLED
GLOOM,
NAKED
BREASTS,
ARMS,
LEGS,
GLARING
EYES
--
THE
BUSH
WAS
SWARMING
WITH
HUMAN
LIMBS
IN
MOVEMENT,
GLISTENING,
OF
BRONZE
COLOUR.
THE
TWIGS
SHOOK,
SWAYED,
AND
RUSTLED,
THE
ARROWS
FLEW
OUT
OF
THEM,
AND
THEN
THE
SHUTTER
CAME
TO.
'STEER
HER
STRAIGHT,'
I
SAID
TO
THE
HELMSMAN.
HE
HELD
HIS
HEAD
RIGID,
FACE
FORWARD;
BUT
HIS
EYES
ROLLED,
HE
KEPT
ON
LIFTING
AND
SETTING
DOWN
HIS
FEET
GENTLY,
HIS
MOUTH
FOAMED
A
LITTLE.
'KEEP
QUIET!'
I
SAID
IN
A
FURY.
I
MIGHT
JUST
AS
WELL
HAVE
ORDERED
A
TREE
NOT
TO
SWAY
IN
THE
WIND.
I
DARTED
OUT.
BELOW
ME
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
SCUFFLE
OF
FEET
ON
THE
IRON
DECK;
CONFUSED
EXCLAMATIONS;
A
VOICE
SCREAMED,
'CAN
YOU
TURN
BACK?'
I
CAUGHT
SIGHT
OF
A
V-SHAPED
RIPPLE
ON
THE
WATER
AHEAD.
WHAT?
ANOTHER
SNAG!
A
FUSILLADE
BURST
OUT
UNDER
MY
FEET.
THE
PILGRIMS
HAD
OPENED
WITH
THEIR
WINCHESTERS,
AND
WERE
SIMPLY
SQUIRTING
LEAD
INTO
THAT
BUSH.
A
DEUCE
OF
A
LOT
OF
SMOKE
CAME
UP
AND
DROVE
SLOWLY
FORWARD.
I
SWORE
AT
IT.
NOW
I
COULDN'T
SEE
THE
RIPPLE
OR
THE
SNAG
EITHER.
I
STOOD
IN
THE
DOORWAY,
PEERING,
AND
THE
ARROWS
CAME
IN
SWARMS.
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
POISONED,
BUT
THEY
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WOULDN'T
KILL
A
CAT.
THE
BUSH
BEGAN
TO
HOWL.
OUR
WOOD-CUTTERS
RAISED
A
WARLIKE
WHOOP;
THE
REPORT
OF
A
RIFLE
JUST
AT
MY
BACK
DEAFENED
ME.
I
GLANCED
OVER
MY
SHOULDER,
AND
THE
PILOT-HOUSE
WAS
YET
FULL
OF
NOISE
AND
SMOKE
WHEN
I
MADE
A
DASH
AT
THE
WHEEL.
THE
FOOL-NIGGER
HAD
DROPPED
EVERYTHING,
TO
THROW
THE
SHUTTER
OPEN
AND
LET
OFF
THAT
MARTINI-HENRY.
HE
STOOD
BEFORE
THE
WIDE
OPENING,
GLARING,
AND
I
YELLED
AT
HIM
TO
COME
BACK,
WHILE
I
STRAIGHTENED
THE
SUDDEN
TWIST
OUT
OF
THAT
STEAMBOAT.
THERE
WAS
NO
ROOM
TO
TURN
EVEN
IF
I
HAD
WANTED
TO,
THE
SNAG
WAS
SOMEWHERE
VERY
NEAR
AHEAD
IN
THAT
CONFOUNDED
SMOKE,
THERE
WAS
NO
TIME
TO
LOSE,
SO
I
JUST
CROWDED
HER
INTO
THE
BANK
--
RIGHT
INTO
THE
BANK,
WHERE
I
KNEW
THE
WATER
WAS
DEEP.
"WE
TORE
SLOWLY
ALONG
THE
OVERHANGING
BUSHES
IN
A
WHIRL
OF
BROKEN
TWIGS
AND
FLYING
LEAVES.
THE
FUSIL-
LADE
BELOW
STOPPED
SHORT,
AS
I
HAD
FORESEEN
IT
WOULD
WHEN
THE
SQUIRTS
GOT
EMPTY.
I
THREW
MY
HEAD
BACK
TO
A
GLINTING
WHIZZ
THAT
TRAVERSED
THE
PILOT-HOUSE,
IN
AT
ONE
SHUTTER-HOLE
AND
OUT
AT
THE
OTHER.
LOOKING
PAST
THAT
MAD
HELMSMAN,
WHO
WAS
SHAKING
THE
EMPTY
RIFLE
AND
YELLING
AT
THE
SHORE,
I
SAW
VAGUE
FORMS
OF
MEN
RUN-
NING
BENT
DOUBLE,
LEAPING,
GLIDING,
DISTINCT,
INCOM-
PLETE,
EVANESCENT.
SOMETHING
BIG
APPEARED
IN
THE
AIR
BEFORE
THE
SHUTTER,
THE
RIFLE
WENT
OVERBOARD,
AND
THE
MAN
STEPPED
BACK
SWIFTLY,
LOOKED
AT
ME
OVER
HIS
SHOULDER
IN
AN
EXTRAORDINARY,
PROFOUND,
FAMILIAR
MAN-
NER,
AND
FELL
UPON
MY
FEET.
THE
SIDE
OF
HIS
HEAD
HIT
THE
WHEEL
TWICE,
AND
THE
END
OF
WHAT
APPEARED
A
LONG
CANE
CLATTERED
ROUND
AND
KNOCKED
OVER
A
LITTLE
CAMP-
STOOL.
IT
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
AFTER
WRENCHING
THAT
THING
FROM
SOMEBODY
ASHORE
HE
HAD
LOST
HIS
BALANCE
IN
THE
EFFORT.
THE
THIN
SMOKE
HAD
BLOWN
AWAY,
WE
WERE
CLEAR
OF
THE
SNAG,
AND
LOOKING
AHEAD
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
IN
ANOTHER
HUNDRED
YARDS
OR
SO
I
WOULD
BE
FREE
TO
SHEER
OFF,
AWAY
FROM
THE
BANK;
BUT
MY
FEET
FELT
SO
VERY
WARM
AND
WET
THAT
I
HAD
TO
LOOK
DOWN.
THE
MAN
HAD
ROLLED
ON
HIS
BACK
AND
STARED
STRAIGHT
UP
AT
ME;
BOTH
HIS
HANDS
CLUTCHED
THAT
CANE.
IT
WAS
THE
SHAFT
OF
A
SPEAR
THAT,
EITHER
THROWN
OR
LUNGED
THROUGH
THE
OPEN-
ING,
HAD
CAUGHT
HIM
IN
THE
SIDE
JUST
BELOW
THE
RIBS;
THE
BLADE
HAD
GONE
IN
OUT
OF
SIGHT,
AFTER
MAKING
A
FRIGHTFUL
GASH;
MY
SHOES
WERE
FULL;
A
POOL
OF
BLOOD
LAY
VERY
STILL,
GLEAMING
DARK-RED
UNDER
THE
WHEEL;
HIS
EYES
SHONE
WITH
AN
AMAZING
LUSTRE.
THE
FUSILLADE
BURST
OUT
AGAIN.
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
ANXIOUSLY,
GRIPPING
THE
SPEAR
LIKE
SOMETHING
PRECIOUS,
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
BEING
AFRAID
I
WOULD
TRY
TO
TAKE
IT
AWAY
FROM
HIM.
I
HAD
TO
MAKE
AN
EFFORT
TO
FREE
MY
EYES
FROM
HIS
GAZE
AND
ATTEND
TO
THE
STEERING.
WITH
ONE
HAND
I
FELT
ABOVE
MY
HEAD
FOR
THE
LINE
OF
THE
STEAM
WHISTLE,
AND
JERKED
OUT
SCREECH
AFTER
SCREECH
HURRIEDLY.
THE
TUMULT
OF
ANGRY
AND
WARLIKE
YELLS
WAS
CHECKED
INSTANTLY,
AND
THEN
FROM
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
WOODS
WENT
OUT
SUCH
A
TREMULOUS
AND
PROLONGED
WAIL
OF
MOURNFUL
FEAR
AND
UTTER
DESPAIR
AS
MAY
BE
IMAGINED
TO
FOLLOW
THE
FLIGHT
OF
THE
LAST
HOPE
FROM
THE
EARTH.
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
COMMOTION
IN
THE
BUSH;
THE
SHOWER
OF
ARROWS
STOPPED,
A
FEW
DROP-
PING
SHOTS
RANG
OUT
SHARPLY
--
THEN
SILENCE,
IN
WHICH
THE
LANGUID
BEAT
OF
THE
STERN-WHEEL
CAME
PLAINLY
TO
MY
EARS.
I
PUT
THE
HELM
HARD
A-STARBOARD
AT
THE
MO-
MENT
WHEN
THE
PILGRIM
IN
PINK
PYJAMAS,
VERY
HOT
AND
AGITATED,
APPEARED
IN
THE
DOORWAY.
'THE
MANAGER
SENDS
ME
--'
HE
BEGAN
IN
AN
OFFICIAL
TONE,
AND
STOPPED
SHORT.
'GOOD
GOD!'
HE
SAID,
GLARING
AT
THE
WOUNDED
MAN.


"WE
TWO
WHITES
STOOD
OVER
HIM,
AND
HIS
LUSTROUS
AND
INQUIRING
GLANCE
ENVELOPED
US
BOTH.
I
DECLARE
IT
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
HE
WOULD
PRESENTLY
PUT
TO
US
SOME
QUESTION
IN
AN
UNDERSTANDABLE
LANGUAGE;
BUT
HE
DIED
WITHOUT
UTTERING
A
SOUND,
WITHOUT
MOVING
A
LIMB,
WITHOUT
TWITCHING
A
MUSCLE.
ONLY
IN
THE
VERY
LAST
MOMENT,
AS
THOUGH
IN
RESPONSE
TO
SOME
SIGN
WE
COULD
NOT
SEE,
TO
SOME
WHISPER
WE
COULD
NOT
HEAR,
HE
FROWNED
HEAVILY,
AND
THAT
FROWN
GAVE
TO
HIS
BLACK
DEATH-MASK
AN
INCONCEIVABLY
SOMBRE,
BROODING,
AND
MENACING
EXPRESSION.
THE
LUSTRE
OF
INQUIRING
GLANCE
FADED
SWIFTLY
INTO
VACANT
GLASSINESS.
'CAN
YOU
STEER?'
I
ASKED
THE
AGENT
EAGERLY.
HE
LOOKED
VERY
DUBIOUS;
BUT
I
MADE
A
GRAB
AT
HIS
ARM,
AND
HE
UNDERSTOOD
AT
ONCE
I
MEANT
HIM
TO
STEER
WHETHER
OR
NO.
TO
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH,
I
WAS
MORBIDLY
ANXIOUS
TO
CHANGE
MY
SHOES
AND
SOCKS.
'HE
IS
DEAD,'
MURMURED
THE
FELLOW,
IMMENSELY
IMPRESSED.
'NO
DOUBT
ABOUT
IT,'
SAID
I,
TUGGING
LIKE
MAD
AT
THE
SHOE
LACES.
'AND
BY
THE
WAY,
I
SUPPOSE
MR.
KURTZ
IS
DEAD
AS
WELL
BY
THIS
TIME.'


"FOR
THE
MOMENT
THAT
WAS
THE
DOMINANT
THOUGHT.
THERE
WAS
A
SENSE
OF
EXTREME
DISAPPOINTMENT,
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
FOUND
OUT
I
HAD
BEEN
STRIVING
AFTER
SOME-
THING
ALTOGETHER
WITHOUT
A
SUBSTANCE.
I
COULDN'T
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
DISGUSTED
IF
I
HAD
TRAVELLED
ALL
THIS
WAY
FOR
THE
SOLE
PURPOSE
OF
TALKING
WITH
MR.
KURTZ.
TALK-
ING
WITH
.
.
.
I
FLUNG
ONE
SHOE
OVERBOARD,
AND
BECAME
AWARE
THAT
THAT
WAS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
HAD
BEEN
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
--
A
TALK
WITH
KURTZ.
I
MADE
THE
STRANGE
DISCOVERY
THAT
I
HAD
NEVER
IMAGINED
HIM
AS
DOING,
YOU
KNOW,
BUT
AS
DISCOURSING.
I
DIDN'T
SAY
TO
MYSELF,
'NOW
I
WILL
NEVER
SEE
HIM,'
OR
'NOW
I
WILL
NEVER
SHAKE
HIM
BY
THE
HAND,'
BUT,
'NOW
I
WILL
NEVER
HEAR
HIM.'
THE
MAN
PRESENTED
HIMSELF
AS
A
VOICE.
NOT
OF
COURSE
THAT
I
DID
NOT
CONNECT
HIM
WITH
SOME
SORT
OF
ACTION.
HADN'T
I
BEEN
TOLD
IN
ALL
THE
TONES
OF
JEALOUSY
AND
ADMIRATION
THAT
HE
HAD
COLLECTED,
BARTERED,
SWINDLED,
OR
STOLEN
MORE
IVORY
THAN
ALL
THE
OTHER
AGENTS
TO-
GETHER?
THAT
WAS
NOT
THE
POINT.
THE
POINT
WAS
IN
HIS
BEING
A
GIFTED
CREATURE,
AND
THAT
OF
ALL
HIS
GIFTS
THE
ONE
THAT
STOOD
OUT
PREEMINENTLY,
THAT
CARRIED
WITH
IT
A
SENSE
OF
REAL
PRESENCE,
WAS
HIS
ABILITY
TO
TALK,
HIS
WORDS
--
THE
GIFT
OF
EXPRESSION,
THE
BEWILDERING,
THE
ILLUMINATING,
THE
MOST
EXALTED
AND
THE
MOST
CON-
TEMPTIBLE,
THE
PULSATING
STREAM
OF
LIGHT,
OR
THE
DECEIT-
FUL
FLOW
FROM
THE
HEART
OF
AN
IMPENETRABLE
DARKNESS.


"THE
OTHER
SHOE
WENT
FLYING
UNTO
THE
DEVIL-GOD
OF
THAT
RIVER.
I
THOUGHT,
'BY
JOVE!
IT'S
ALL
OVER.
WE
ARE
TOO
LATE;
HE
HAS
VANISHED
--
THE
GIFT
HAS
VANISHED,
BY
MEANS
OF
SOME
SPEAR,
ARROW,
OR
CLUB.
I
WILL
NEVER
HEAR
THAT
CHAP
SPEAK
AFTER
ALL'
--
AND
MY
SORROW
HAD
A
STAR-
TLING
EXTRAVAGANCE
OF
EMOTION,
EVEN
SUCH
AS
I
HAD
NOTICED
IN
THE
HOWLING
SORROW
OF
THESE
SAVAGES
IN
THE
BUSH.
I
COULDN'T
HAVE
FELT
MORE
OF
LONELY
DESOLATION
SOMEHOW,
HAD
I
BEEN
ROBBED
OF
A
BELIEF
OR
HAD
MISSED
MY
DESTINY
IN
LIFE....
WHY
DO
YOU
SIGH
IN
THIS
BEASTLY
WAY,
SOMEBODY?
ABSURD?
WELL,
ABSURD.
GOOD
LORD!
MUSTN'T
A
MAN
EVER
--
HERE,
GIVE
ME
SOME
TOBACCO."...



THERE
WAS
A
PAUSE
OF
PROFOURD
STILLNESS,
THEN
A
MATCH
FLARED,
AND
MARLOW'S
LEAN
FACE
APPEARED,
WORN,
HOLLOW,
WITH
DOWNWARD
FOLDS
AND
DROPPED
EYELIDS,
WITH
AN
ASPECT
OF
CONCENTRATED
ABTENTION;
AND
AS
HE
TOOK
VIGOROUS
DRAWS
AT
HIS
PIPE,
IT
SEEMED
TO
RETREAT
AND
ADVANCE
OUT
OF
THE
NIGHT
IN
THE
REGULAR
FLICKER
OF
TINY
FLAME.
THE
MATCH
WENT
OUT.


"ABSURD!"
HE
CRIED.
"THIS
IS
THE
WORST
OF
TRYING
TO
TELL....
HERE
YOU
ALL
ARE,
EACH
MOORED
WITH
TWO
GOOD
ADDRESSES,
LIKE
A
HULK
WITH
TWO
ANCHORS,
A
BUTCHER
ROUND
ONE
CORNER,
A
POLICEMAN
ROUND
ANOTHER,
EXCEL-
LENT
APPETITES,
AND
TEMPERATURE
NORMAL
--
YOU
HEAR
--
NORMAL
FROM
YEAR'S
END
TO
YEAR'S
END.
AND
YOU
SAY,
ABSURD!
ABSURD
BE
--
EXPLODED!
ABSURD!
MY
DEAR
BOYS,
WHAT
CAN
YOU
EXPECT
FROM
A
MAN
WHO
OUT
OF
SHEER
NERVOUSNESS
HAD
JUST
FLUNG
OVERBOARD
A
PAIR
OF
NEW
SHOES!
NOW
I
THINK
OF
IT,
IT
IS
AMAZING
I
DID
NOT
SHED
TEARS.
I
AM,
UPON
THE
WHOLE,
PROUD
OF
MY
FORTI-
TUDE.
I
WAS
CUT
TO
THE
QUICK
AT
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
LOST
THE
INESTIMABLE
PRIVILEGE
OF
LISTENING
TO
THE
GIFTED
KURTZ.
OF
COURSE
I
WAS
WRONG.
THE
PRIVILEGE
WAS
WAITING
FOR
ME.
OH,
YES,
I
HEARD
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH.
AND
I
WAS
RIGHT,
TOO.
A
VOICE.
HE
WAS
VERY
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
A
VOICE.
AND
I
HEARD
--
HIM
--
IT
--
THIS
VOICE
--
OTHER
VOICES
--
ALL
OF
THEM
WERE
SO
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
VOICES
--
AND
THE
MEMORY
OF
THAT
TIME
ITSELF
LINGERS
AROUND
ME,
IMPALPABLE,
LIKE
A
DYING
VIBRATION
OF
ONE
IMMENSE
JABBER,
SILLY,
ATROCIOUS,
SORDID,
SAVAGE,
OR
SIMPLY
MEAN,
WITHOUT
ANY
KIND
OF
SENSE.
VOICES,
VOICES
--
EVEN
THE
GIRL
HERSELF
--
NOW
--"


HE
WAS
SILENT
FOR
A
LONG
TIME.


"I
LAID
THE
GHOST
OF
HIS
GIFTS
AT
LAST
WITH
A
LIE,"
HE
BEGAN,
SUDDENLY.
"GIRL!
WHAT?
DID
I
MENTION
A
GIRL?
OH,
SHE
IS
OUT
OF
IT
--
COMPLETELY.
THEY
--
THE
WOMEN
I
MEAN
--
ARE
OUT
OF
IT
--
SHOULD
BE
OUT
OF
IT.
WE
MUST
HELP
THEM
TO
STAY
IN
THAT
BEAUTIFUL
WORLD
OF
THEIR
OWN,
LEST
OURS
GETS
WORSE.
OH,
SHE
HAD
TO
BE
OUT
OF
IT.
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
HEARD
THE
DISINTERRED
BODY
OF
MR.
KURTZ
SAYING,
'MY
INTENDED.'
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
PERCEIVED
DIRECTLY
THEN
HOW
COMPLETELY
SHE
WAS
OUT
OF
IT.
AND
THE
LOFTY
FRONTAL
BONE
OF
MR.
KURTZ!
THEY
SAY
THE
HAIR
GOES
ON
GROWING
SOMETIMES,
BUT
THIS
--
AH
--
SPECI-
MEN,
WAS
IMPRESSIVELY
BALD.
THE
WILDERNESS
HAD
PATTED
HIM
ON
THE
HEAD,
AND,
BEHOLD,
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
BALL
--
AN
IVORY
BALL;
IT
HAD
CARESSED
HIM,
AND
--
LO!
--
HE
HAD
WITHERED;
IT
HAD
TAKEN
HIM,
LOVED
HIM,
EMBRACED
HIM,
GOT
INTO
HIS
VEINS,
CONSUMED
HIS
FLESH,
AND
SEALED
HIS
SOUL
TO
ITS
OWN
BY
THE
INCONCEIVABLE
CEREMONIES
OF
SOME
DEVILISH
INITIATION.
HE
WAS
ITS
SPOILED
AND
PAM-
PERED
FAVOURITE.
IVORY?
I
SHOULD
THINK
SO.
HEAPS
OF
IT,
STACKS
OF
IT.
THE
OLD
MUD
SHANTY
WAS
BURSTING
WITH
IT.
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
SINGLE
TUSK
LEFT
EITHER
ABOVE
OR
BELOW
THE
GROUND
IN
THE
WHOLE
COUNTRY.
'MOSTLY
FOSSIL,'
THE
MANAGER
HAD
REMARKED,
DISPARAGINGLY.
IT
WAS
NO
MORE
FOSSIL
THAN
I
AM;
BUT
THEY
CALL
IT
FOSSIL
WHEN
IT
IS
DUG
UP.
IT
APPEARS
THESE
NIGGERS
DO
BURY
THE
TUSKS
SOMETIMES
--
BUT
EVIDENTLY
THEY
COULDN'T
BURY
THIS
PARCEL
DEEP
ENOUGH
TO
SAVE
THE
GIFTED
MR.
KURTZ
FROM
HIS
FATE.
WE
FILLED
THE
STEAM-
BOAT
WITH
IT,
AND
HAD
TO
PILE
A
LOT
ON
THE
DECK.
THUS
HE
COULD
SEE
AND
ENJOY
AS
LONG
AS
HE
COULD
SEE,
BECAUSE
THE
APPRECIATION
OF
THIS
FAVOUR
HAD
REMAINED
WITH
HIM
TO
THE
LAST.
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
HEARD
HIM
SAY,
'MY
IVORY.'
OH,
YES,
I
HEARD
HIM.
'MY
INTENDED,
MY
IVORY,
MY
STATION,
MY
RIVER,
MY
--'
EVERYTHING
BELONGED
TO
HIM.
IT
MADE
ME
HOLD
MY
BREATH
IN
EXPECTATION
OF
HEARING
THE
WILDERNESS
BURST
INTO
A
PRODIGIOUS
PEAL
OF
LAUGHTER
THAT
WOULD
SHAKE
THE
FIXED
STARS
IN
THEIR
PLACES.
EVERYTHING
BELONGED
TO
HIM
--
BUT
THAT
WAS
A
TRIFLE.
THE
THING
WAS
TO
KNOW
WHAT
HE
BELONGED
TO,
HOW
MANY
POWERS
OF
DARKNESS
CLAIMED
HIM
FOR
THEIR
OWN.
THAT
WAS
THE
REFLECTION
THAT
MADE
YOU
CREEPY
ALL
OVER.
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
--
IT
WAS
NOT
GOOD
FOR
ONE
EITHER
--
TRYING
TO
IMAGINE.
HE
HAD
TAKEN
A
HIGH
SEAT
AMONGST
THE
DEVILS
OF
THE
LAND
--
I
MEAN
LITERALLY.
YOU
CAN'T
UNDERSTAND.
HOW
COULD
YOU?
--
WITH
SOLID
PAVEMENT
UNDER
YOUR
FEET,
SURROUNDED
BY
KIND
NEIGHBOURS
READY
TO
CHEER
YOU
OR
TO
FALL
ON
YOU,
STEPPING
DELI-
CATELY
BETWEEN
THE
BUTCHER
AND
THE
POLICEMAN,
IN
THE
HOLY
TERROR
OF
SCANDAL
AND
GALLOWS
AND
LUNATIC
ASYLUMS
--
HOW
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
PARTICULAR
REGION
OF
THE
FIRST
AGES
A
MAN'S
UNTRAMMELLED
FEET
MAY
TAKE
HIM
INTO
BY
THE
WAY
OF
SOLITUDE
--
UTTER
SOLITUDE
WITHOUT
A
POLICEMAN
--
BY
THE
WAY
OF
SILENCE
--
UTTER
SILENCE,
WHERE
NO
WARNING
VOICE
OF
A
KIND
NEIGHBOUR
CAN
BE
HEARD
WHISPERING
OF
PUBLIC
OPINION?
THESE
LITTLE
THINGS
MAKE
ALL
THE
GREAT
DIFFERENCE.
WHEN
THEY
ARE
GONE
YOU
MUST
FALL
BACK
UPON
YOUR
OWN
INNATE
STRENGTH,
UPON
YOUR
OWN
CAPACITY
FOR
FAITHFULNESS.
OF
COURSE
YOU
MAY
BE
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
FOOL
TO
GO
WRONG
--

TOO
DULL
EVEN
TO
KNOW
YOU
ARE
BEING
ASSAULTED
BY
THE
POWERS
OF
DARKNESS.
I
TAKE
IT,
NO
FOOL
EVER
MADE
A
BARGAIN
FOR
HIS
SOUL
WITH
THE
DEVIL;
THE
FOOL
IS
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
FOOL,
OR
THE
DEVIL
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
DEVIL
--
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHICH.
OR
YOU
MAY
BE
SUCH
A
THUNDERINGLY
EXALTED
CREATURE
AS
TO
BE
ALTOGETHER
DEAF
AND
BLIND
TO
ANYTHING
BUT
HEAVENLY
SIGHTS
AND
SOUNDS.
THEN
THE
EARTH
FOR
YOU
IS
ONLY
A
STANDING
PLACE
--
AND
WHETHER
TO
BE
LIKE
THIS
IS
YOUR
LOSS
OR
YOUR
GAIN
I
WON'T
PRETEND
TO
SAY.
BUT
MOST
OF
US
ARE
NEITHER
ONE
NOR
THE
OTHER.
THE
EARTH
FOR
US
IS
A
PLACE
TO
LIVE
IN,
WHERE
WE
MUST
PUT
UP
WITH
SIGHTS,
WITH
SOUNDS,
WITH
SMELLS,
TOO,
BY
JOVE!
--
BREATHE
DEAD
HIPPO,
SO
TO
SPEAK,
AND
NOT
BE
CONTAMINATED.
AND
THERE,
DON'T
YOU
SEE?
YOUR
STRENGTH
COMES
IN,
THE
FAITH
IN
YOUR
ABILITY
FOR
THE
DIGGING
OF
UNOSTENTATIOUS
HOLES
TO
BURY
THE
STUFF
IN
--
YOUR
POWER
OF
DEVOTION,
NOT
TO
YOURSELF,
BUT
TO
AN
OBSCURE
BACK-BREAKING
BUSI-
NESS.
AND
THAT'S
DIFFICULT
ENOUGH.
MIND,
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
EXCUSE
OR
EVEN
EXPLAIN
--
I
AM
TRYING
TO
AC-
COUNT
TO
MYSELF
FOR
--
FOR
--
MR.
KURTZ
--
FOR
THE
SHADE
OF
MR.
KURTZ.
THIS
INITIATED
WRAITH
FROM
THE
BACK
OF
NOWHERE
HONOURED
ME
WITH
ITS
AMAZING
CONFIDENCE
BEFORE
IT
VANISHED
ALTOGETHER.
THIS
WAS
BECAUSE
IT
COULD
SPEAK
ENGLISH
TO
ME.
THE
ORIGINAL
KURTZ
HAD
BEEN
EDUCATED
PARTLY
IN
ENGLAND,
AND
--
AS
HE
WAS
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
HIMSELF
--
HIS
SYMPATHIES
WERE
IN
THE
RIGHT
PLACE.
HIS
MOTHER
WAS
HALF-ENGLISH,
HIS
FATHER
WAS
HALF-FRENCH.
ALL
EUROPE
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
MAKING
OF
KURTZ;
AND
BY
AND
BY
I
LEARNED
THAT,
MOST
APPROPRIATELY,
THE
INTERNATIONAL
SOCIETY
FOR
THE
SUPPRESSION
OF
SAVAGE
CUSTOMS
HAD
INTRUSTED
HIM
WITH
THE
MAKING
OF
A
REPORT,
FOR
ITS
FUTURE
GUID-
ANCE.
AND
HE
HAD
WRITTEN
IT,
TOO.
I'VE
SEEN
IT.
I'VE
READ
IT.
IT
WAS
ELOQUENT,
VIBRATING
WITH
ELOQUENCE,
BUT
TOO
HIGH-STRUNG,
I
THINK.
SEVENTEEN
PAGES
OF
CLOSE
WRITING
HE
HAD
FOUND
TIME
FOR!
BUT
THIS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
BEFORE
HIS
--
LET
US
SAY
--
NERVES,
WENT
WRONG,
AND
CAUSED
HIM
TO
PRESIDE
AT
CERTAIN
MIDNIGHT
DANCES
ENDING
WITH
UNSPEAKABLE
RITES,
WHICH
--
AS
FAR
AS
I
RELUCTANTLY
GATHERED
FROM
WHAT
I
HEARD
AT
VARIOUS
TIMES
--
WERE
OFFERED
UP
TO
HIM
--
DO
YOU
UNDER-
STAND?
--
TO
MR.
KURTZ
HIMSELF.
BUT
IT
WAS
A
BEAUTIFUL
PIECE
OF
WRITING.
THE
OPENING
PARAGRAPH,
HOWEVER,
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
LATER
INFORMATION,
STRIKES
ME
NOW
AS
OMINOUS.
HE
BEGAN
WITH
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
WE
WHITES,
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
DEVELOPMENT
WE
HAD
ARRIVED
AT,
'MUST
NECESSARILY
APPEAR
TO
THEM
[SAVAGES]
IN
THE
NATURE
OF
SUPERNATURAL
BEINGS
--
WE
APPROACH
THEM
WITH
THE
MIGHT
AS
OF
A
DEITY,'
AND
SO
ON,
AND
SO
ON.
'BY
THE
SIMPLE
EXERCISE
OF
OUR
WILL
WE
CAN
EXERT
A
POWER
FOR
GOOD
PRACTICALLY
UNBOUNDED,'
ETC.,
ETC.
FROM
THAT
POINT
HE
SOARED
AND
TOOK
ME
WITH
HIM.
THE
PERORATION
WAS
MAGNIFICENT,
THOUGH
DIFFICULT
TO
REMEMBER,
YOU
KNOW.
IT
GAVE
ME
THE
NOTION
OF
AN
EXOTIC
IMMENSITY
RULED
BY
AN
AUGUST
BENEVOLENCE.
IT
MADE
ME
TINGLE
WITH
ENTHUSIASM.
THIS
WAS
THE
UNBOUNDED
POWER
OF
ELOQUENCE
--
OF
WORDS
--
OF
BURNING
NOBLE
WORDS.
THERE
WERE
NO
PRACTICAL
HINTS
TO
INTERRUPT
THE
MAGIC
CURRENT
OF
PHRASES,
UNLESS
A
KIND
OF
NOTE
AT
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
LAST
PAGE,
SCRAWLED
EVIDENTLY
MUCH
LATER,
IN
AN
UNSTEADY
HAND,
MAY
BE
REGARDED
AS
THE
EXPOSITION
OF
A
METHOD.
IT
WAS
VERY
SIMPLE,
AND
AT
THE
END
OF
THAT
MOVING
APPEAL
TO
EVERY
ALTRUISTIC
SENTIMENT
IT
BLAZED
AT
YOU,
LUMINOUS
AND
TERRIFYING,
LIKE
A
FLASH
OF
LIGHTNING
IN
A
SERENE
SKY:
'EXTERMINATE
ALL
THE
BRUTES!'
THE
CURIOUS
PART
WAS
THAT
HE
HAD
APPARENTLY
FORGOTTEN
ALL
ABOUT
THAT
VALUABLE
POSTSCRIPTUM,
BECAUSE,
LATER
ON,
WHEN
HE
IN
A
SENSE
CAME
TO
HIMSELF,
HE
REPEATEDLY
ENTREATED
ME
TO
TAKE
GOOD
CARE
OF
'MY
PAMPHLET'
(HE
CALLED
IT),
AS
IT
WAS
SURE
TO
HAVE
IN
THE
FUTURE
A
GOOD
INFLUENCE
UPON
HIS
CAREER.
I
HAD
FULL
INFORMATION
ABOUT
ALL
THESE
THINGS,
AND,
BESIDES,
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT,
I
WAS
TO
HAVE
THE
CARE
OF
HIS
MEMORY.
I'VE
DONE
ENOUGH
FOR
IT
TO
GIVE
ME
THE
INDISPUTABLE
RIGHT
TO
LAY
IT,
IF
I
CHOOSE,
FOR
AN
EVERLASTING
REST
IN
THE
DUST-BIN
OF
PROGRESS,
AMONGST
ALL
THE
SWEEPINGS
AND,
FIGURATIVELY
SPEAKING,
ALL
THE
DEAD
CATS
OF
CIVILIZATION.
BUT
THEN,
YOU
SEE,
I
CAN'T
CHOOSE.
HE
WON'T
BE
FORGOTTEN.
WHATEVER
HE
WAS,
HE
WAS
NOT
COMMON.
HE
HAD
THE
POWER
TO
CHARM
OR
FRIGHTEN
RUDIMENTARY
SOULS
INTO
AN
AGGRAVATED
WITCH-DANCE
IN
HIS
HONOUR;
HE
COULD
ALSO
FILL
THE
SMALL
SOULS
OF
THE
PILGRIMS
WITH
BITTER
MISGIVINGS:
HE
HAD
ONE
DEVOTED
FRIEND
AT
LEAST,
AND
HE
HAD
CONQUERED
ONE
SOUL
IN
THE
WORLD
THAT
WAS
NEITHER
RUDIMENTARY
NOR
TAINTED
WITH
SELF-SEEKING.
NO;
I
CAN'T
FORGET
HIM,
THOUGH
I
AM
NOT
PREPARED
TO
AFFIRM
THE
FELLOW
WAS
EXACTLY
WORTH
THE
LIFE
WE
LOST
IN
GETTING
TO
HIM.
I
MISSED
MY
LATE
HELMSMAN
AWFULLY
--
I
MISSED
HIM
EVEN
WHILE
HIS
BODY
WAS
STILL
LYING
IN
THE
PILOT-HOUSE.
PERHAPS
YOU
WILL
THINK
IT
PASSING
STRANGE
THIS
REGRET
FOR
A
SAVAGE
WHO
WAS
NO
MORE
ACCOUNT
THAN
A
GRAIN
OF
SAND
IN
A
BLACK
SAHARA.
WELL,
DON'T
YOU
SEE,
HE
HAD
DONE
SOMETHING,
HE
HAD
STEERED;
FOR
MONTHS
I
HAD
HIM
AT
MY
BACK
--
A
HELP
--
AN
INSTRUMENT.
IT
WAS
A
KIND
OF
PARTNERSHIP.
HE
STEERED
FOR
ME
--
I
HAD
TO
LOOK
AFTER
HIM,
I
WORRIED
ABOUT
HIS
DEFICIENCIES,
AND
THUS
A
SUBTLE
BOND
HAD
BEEN
CREATED,
OF
WHICH
I
ONLY
BECAME
AWARE
WHEN
IT
WAS
SUDDENLY
BROKEN.
AND
THE
INTIMATE
PRO-
FUNDITY
OF
THAT
LOOK
HE
GAVE
ME
WHEN
HE
RECEIVED
HIS
HURT
REMAINS
TO
THIS
DAY
IN
MY
MEMORY
--
LIKE
A
CLAIM
OF
DISTANT
KINSHIP
AFFIRMED
IN
A
SUPREME
MOMENT.


"POOR
FOOL!
IF
HE
HAD
ONLY
LEFT
THAT
SHUTTER
ALONE.
HE
HAD
NO
RESTRAINT,
NO
RESTRAINT
JUST
LIKE
KURTZ
--
A
TREE
SWAYED
BY
THE
WIND.
AS
SOON
AS
I
HAD
PUT
ON
A
DRY
PAIR
OF
SLIPPERS,
I
DRAGGED
HIM
OUT,
AFTER
FIRST
JERKING
THE
SPEAR
OUT
OF
HIS
SIDE,
WHICH
OPERATION
I
CONFESS
I
PERFORMED
WITH
MY
EYES
SHUT
TIGHT.
HIS
HEELS
LEAPED
TOGETHER
OVER
THE
LITTLE
DOORSTEP;
HIS
SHOULDERS
WERE
PRESSED
TO
MY
BREAST;
I
HUGGED
HIM
FROM
BEHIND
DES-
PERATELY.
OH!
HE
WAS
HEAVY,
HEAVY;
HEAVIER
THAN
ANY
MAN
ON
EARTH,
I
SHOULD
IMAGINE.
THEN
WITHOUT
MORE
ADO
I
TIPPED
HIM
OVERBOARD.
THE
CURRENT
SNATCHED
HIM
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
BEEN
A
WISP
OF
GRASS,
AND
I
SAW
THE
BODY
ROLL
OVER
TWICE
BEFORE
I
LOST
SIGHT
OF
IT
FOR
EVER.
ALL
THE
PILGRIMS
AND
THE
MANAGER
WERE
THEN
CONGREGATED
ON
THE
AWNING-DECK
ABOUT
THE
PILOT-HOUSE,
CHATTERING
AT
EACH
OTHER
LIKE
A
FLOCK
OF
EXCITED
MAGPIES,
AND
THERE
WAS
A
SCANDALIZED
MURMUR
AT
MY
HEARTLESS
PROMPTITUDE.
WHAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
KEEP
THAT
BODY
HANGING
ABOUT
FOR
I
CAN'T
GUESS.
EMBALM
IT,
MAYBE.
BUT
I
HAD
ALSO
HEARD
ANOTHER,
AND
A
VERY
OMINOUS,
MURMUR
ON
THE
DECK
BELOW.
MY
FRIENDS
THE
WOOD-
CUTTERS
WERE
LIKEWISE
SCANDALIZED,
AND
WITH
A
BETTER
SHOW
OF
REASON
--
THOUGH
I
ADMIT
THAT
THE
REASON
ITSELF
WAS
QUITE
INADMISSIBLE.
OH,
QUITE!
I
HAD
MADE
UP
MY
MIND
THAT
IF
MY
LATE
HELMSMAN
WAS
TO
BE
EATEN,
THE
FISHES
ALONE
SHOULD
HAVE
HIM.
HE
HAD
BEEN
A
VERY
SECOND-RATE
HELMSMAN
WHILE
ALIVE,
BUT
NOW
HE
WAS
DEAD
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
BECOME
A
FIRST-CLASS
TEMPTATION,
AND
POSSIBLY
CAUSE
SOME
STARTLING
TROUBLE.
BESIDES,
I
WAS
ANXIOUS
TO
TAKE
THE
WHEEL,
THE
MAN
IN
PINK
PY-
JAMAS
SHOWING
HIMSELF
A
HOPELESS
DUFFER
AT
THE
BUSI-
NESS.


"THIS
I
DID
DIRECTLY
THE
SIMPLE
FUNERAL
WAS
OVER.
WE
WERE
GOING
HALF-SPEED,
KEEPING
RIGHT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
STREAM,
AND
I
LISTENED
TO
THE
TALK
ABOUT
ME.
THEY
HAD
GIVEN
UP
KURTZ,
THEY
HAD
GIVEN
UP
THE
STATION;
KURTZ
WAS
DEAD,
AND
THE
STATION
HAD
BEEN
BURNT
--
AND
SO
ON
--
AND
SO
ON.
THE
RED-HAIRED
PILGRIM
WAS
BESIDE
HIMSELF
WITH
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
AT
LEAST
THIS
POOR
KURTZ
HAD
BEEN
PROPERLY
AVENGED.
'SAY!
WE
MUST
HAVE
MADE
A
GLORIOUS
SLAUGHTER
OF
THEM
IN
THE
BUSH.
EH?
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK?
SAY?'
HE
POSITIVELY
DANCED,
THE
BLOODTHIRSTY
LITTLE
GINGERY
BEGGAR.
AND
HE
HAD
NEARLY
FAINTED
WHEN
HE
SAW
THE
WOUNDED
MAN!
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
SAYING,
'YOU
MADE
A
GLORIOUS
LOT
OF
SMOKE,
ANYHOW.'
I
HAD
SEEN,
FROM
THE
WAY
THE
TOPS
OF
THE
BUSHES
RUSTLED
AND
FLEW,
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
THE
SHOTS
HAD
GONE
TOO
HIGH.
YOU
CAN'T
HIT
ANYTHING
UNLESS
YOU
TAKE
AIM
AND
FIRE
FROM
THE
SHOULDER;
BUT
THESE
CHAPS
FIRED
FROM
THE
HIP
WITH
THEIR
EYES
SHUT.
THE
RETREAT,
I
MAINTAINED
--
AND
I
WAS
RIGHT
--
WAS
CAUSED
BY
THE
SCREECHING
OF
THE
STEAM
WHISTLE.
UPON
THIS
THEY
FORGOT
KURTZ,
AND
BEGAN
TO
HOWL
AT
ME
WITH
INDIGNANT
PROTESTS.


"THE
MANAGER
STOOD
BY
THE
WHEEL
MURMURING
CON-
FIDENTIALLY
ABOUT
THE
NECESSITY
OF
GETTING
WELL
AWAY
DOWN
THE
RIVER
BEFORE
DARK
AT
ALL
EVENTS,
WHEN
I
SAW
IN
THE
DISTANCE
A
CLEARING
ON
THE
RIVERSIDE
AND
THE
OUTLINES
OF
SOME
SORT
OF
BUILDING.
'WHAT'S
THIS?'
I
ASKED.
HE
CLAPPED
HIS
HANDS
IN
WONDER.
'THE
STATION!'
HE
CRIED.
I
EDGED
IN
AT
ONCE,
STILL
GOING
HALF-SPEED.


"THROUGH
MY
GLASSES
I
SAW
THE
SLOPE
OF
A
HILL
INTER-
SPERSED
WITH
RARE
TREES
AND
PERFECTLY
FREE
FROM
UNDER-
GROWTH.
A
LONG
DECAYING
BUILDING
ON
THE
SUMMIT
WAS
HALF
BURIED
IN
THE
HIGH
GRASS;
THE
LARGE
HOLES
IN
THE
PEAKED
ROOF
GAPED
BLACK
FROM
AFAR;
THE
JUNGLE
AND
THE
WOODS
MADE
A
BACKGROUND.
THERE
WAS
NO
EN-
CLOSURE
OR
FENCE
OF
ANY
KIND;
BUT
THERE
HAD
BEEN
ONE
APPARENTLY,
FOR
NEAR
THE
HOUSE
HALF-A-DOZEN
SLIM
POSTS
REMAINED
IN
A
ROW,
ROUGHLY
TRIMMED,
AND
WITH
THEIR
UPPER
ENDS
ORNAMENTED
WITH
ROUND
CARVED
BALLS.
THE
RAILS,
OR
WHATEVER
THERE
HAD
BEEN
BETWEEN,
HAD
DIS-
APPEARED.
OF
COURSE
THE
FOREST
SURROUNDED
ALL
THAT.
THE
RIVER-BANK
WAS
CLEAR,
AND
ON
THE
WATERSIDE
I
SAW
A
WHITE
MAN
UNDER
A
HAT
LIKE
A
CARTWHEEL
BECKONING
PERSISTENTLY
WITH
HIS
WHOLE
ARM.
EXAMINING
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
FOREST
ABOVE
AND
BELOW,
I
WAS
ALMOST
CERTAIN
I
COULD
SEE
MOVEMENTS
--
HUMAN
FORMS
GLIDING
HERE
AND
THERE.
I
STEAMED
PAST
PRUDENTLY,
THEN
STOPPED
THE
ENGINES
AND
LET
HER
DRIFT
DOWN.
THE
MAN
ON
THE
SHORE
BEGAN
TO
SHOUT,
URGING
US
TO
LAND.
'WE
HAVE
BEEN
AT-
TACKED,'
SCREAMED
THE
MANAGER.
'I
KNOW
--
I
KNOW.
IT'S
ALL
RIGHT,'
YELLED
BACK
THE
OTHER,
AS
CHEERFUL
AS
YOU
PLEASE.
'COME
ALONG.
IT'S
ALL
RIGHT.
I
AM
GLAD.'


"HIS
ASPECT
REMINDED
ME
OF
SOMETHING
I
HAD
SEEN
--
SOMETHING
FUNNY
I
HAD
SEEN
SOMEWHERE.
AS
I
MANOEUVRED
TO
GET
ALONGSIDE,
I
WAS
ASKING
MYSELF,
'WHAT
DOES
THIS
FELLOW
LOOK
LIKE?'
SUDDENLY
I
GOT
IT.
HE
LOOKED
LIKE
A
HARLEQUIN.
HIS
CLOTHES
HAD
BEEN
MADE
OF
SOME
STUFF
THAT
WAS
BROWN
HOLLAND
PROBABLY,
BUT
IT
WAS
COVERED
WITH
PATCHES
ALL
OVER,
WITH
BRIGHT
PATCHES,
BLUE,
RED,
AND
YELLOW
--
PATCHES
ON
THE
BACK,
PATCHES
ON
THE
FRONT,
PATCHES
ON
ELBOWS,
ON
KNEES;
COLOURED
BINDING
AROUND
HIS
JACKET,
SCARLET
EDGING
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
HIS
TROUSERS;
AND
THE
SUNSHINE
MADE
HIM
LOOK
EXTREMELY
GAY
AND
WONDERFULLY
NEAT
WITHAL,
BECAUSE
YOU
COULD
SEE
HOW
BEAUTIFULLY
ALL
THIS
PATCHING
HAD
BEEN
DONE.
A
BEARDLESS,
BOYISH
FACE,
VERY
FAIR,
NO
FEATURES
TO
SPEAK
OF,
NOSE
PEELING,
LITTLE
BLUE
EYES,
SMILES
AND
FROWNS
CHASING
EACH
OTHER
OVER
THAT
OPEN
COUNTENANCE
LIKE
SUNSHINE
AND
SHADOW
ON
A
WIND-
SWEPT
PLAIN.
'LOOK
OUT,
CAPTAIN!'
HE
CRIED;
'THERE'S
A
SNAG
LODGED
IN
HERE
LAST
NIGHT.'
WHAT!
ANOTHER
SNAG?
I
CONFESS
I
SWORE
SHAMEFULLY.
I
HAD
NEARLY
HOLED
MY
CRIPPLE,
TO
FINISH
OFF
THAT
CHARMING
TRIP.
THE
HARLEQUIN
ON
THE
BANK
TURNED
HIS
LITTLE
PUG-NOSE
UP
TO
ME.
'YOU
ENGLISH?'
HE
ASKED,
ALL
SMILES.
'ARE
YOU?'
I
SHOUTED
FROM
THE
WHEEL.
THE
SMILES
VANISHED,
AND
HE
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD
AS
IF
SORRY
FOR
MY
DISAPPOINTMENT.
THEN
HE
BRIGHTENED
UP.
'NEVER
MIND!'
HE
CRIED
ENCOURAGINGLY.
'ARE
WE
IN
TIME?'
I
ASKED.
'HE
IS
UP
THERE,'
HE
REPLIED,
WITH
A
TOSS
OF
THE
HEAD
UP
THE
HILL,
AND
BECOMING
GLOOMY
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN.
HIS
FACE
WAS
LIKE
THE
AUTUMN
SKY,
OVERCAST
ONE
MOMENT
AND
BRIGHT
THE
NEXT.


"WHEN
THE
MANAGER,
ESCORTED
BY
THE
PILGRIMS,
ALL
OF
THEM
ARMED
TO
THE
TEETH,
HAD
GONE
TO
THE
HOUSE
THIS
CHAP
CAME
ON
BOARD.
'I
SAY,
I
DON'T
LIKE
THIS.
THESE
NATIVES
ARE
IN
THE
BUSH,'
I
SAID.
HE
ASSURED
ME
EARNESTLY
IT
WAS
ALL
RIGHT.
'THEY
ARE
SIMPLE
PEOPLE,'
HE
ADDED;
'WELL,
I
AM
GLAD
YOU
CAME.
IT
TOOK
ME
ALL
MY
TIME
TO
KEEP
THEM
OFF.'
'BUT
YOU
SAID
IT
WAS
ALL
RIGHT,'
I
CRIED.
'OH,
THEY
MEANT
NO
HARM,'
HE
SAID;
AND
AS
I
STARED
HE
CORRECTED
HIMSELF,
'NOT
EXACTLY.'
THEN
VIVA-
CIOUSLY,
'MY
FAITH,
YOUR
PILOT-HOUSE
WANTS
A
CLEAN-UP!'
IN
THE
NEXT
BREATH
HE
ADVISED
ME
TO
KEEP
ENOUGH
STEAM
ON
THE
BOILER
TO
BLOW
THE
WHISTLE
IN
CASE
OF
ANY
TROUBLE.
'ONE
GOOD
SCREECH
WILL
DO
MORE
FOR
YOU
THAN
ALL
YOUR
RIFLES.
THEY
ARE
SIMPLE
PEOPLE,'
HE
REPEATED.
HE
RATTLED
AWAY
AT
SUCH
A
RATE
HE
QUITE
OVER-
WHELMED
ME.
HE
SEEMED
TO
BE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
UP
FOR
LOTS
OF
SILENCE,
AND
ACTUALLY
HINTED,
LAUGHING,
THAT
SUCH
WAS
THE
CASE.
'DON'T
YOU
TALK
WITH
MR.
KURTZ?'
I
SAID.
'YOU
DON'T
TALK
WITH
THAT
MAN
--
YOU
LISTEN
TO
HIM,'
HE
EXCLAIMED
WITH
SEVERE
EXALTATION.
'BUT
NOW
--'
HE
WAVED
HIS
ARM,
AND
IN
THE
TWINKLING
OF
AN
EYE
WAS
IN
THE
UTTERMOST
DEPTHS
OF
DESPONDENCY.
IN
A
MOMENT
HE
CAME
UP
AGAIN
WITH
A
JUMP,
POSSESSED
HIMSELF
OF
BOTH
MY
HANDS,
SHOOK
THEM
CONTINUOUSLY,
WHILE
HE
GABBLED:
'BROTHER
SAILOR
.
.
.
HONOUR
.
.
.
PLEASURE
.
.
.
DELIGHT
.
.
.INTRODUCE
MYSELF
.
.
.
RUSSIAN
.
.
.
SON
OF
AN
ARCH-PRIEST
.
.
.
GOVERNMENT
OF
TAMBOV
.
.
.
WHAT?
TOBACCO!
ENGLISH
TOBACCO;
THE
EXCELLENT
ENGLISH
TOBACCO!
NOW,
THAT'S
BROTHERLY.
SMOKE?
WHERE'S
A
SAILOR
THAT
DOES
NOT
SMOKE?'


"THE
PIPE
SOOTHED
HIM,
AND
GRADUALLY
I
MADE
OUT
HE
HAD
RUN
AWAY
FROM
SCHOOL,
HAD
GONE
TO
SEA
IN
A
RUSSIAN
SHIP;
RAN
AWAY
AGAIN;
SERVED
SOME
TIME
IN
ENGLISH
SHIPS;
WAS
NOW
RECONCILED
WITH
THE
ARCH-
PRIEST.
HE
MADE
A
POINT
OF
THAT.
'BUT
WHEN
ONE
IS
YOUNG
ONE
MUST
SEE
THINGS,
GATHER
EXPERIENCE,
IDEAS;
ENLARGE
THE
MIND.'
'HERE!'
I
INTERRUPTED.
'YOU
CAN
NEVER
TELL!
HERE
I
MET
MR.
KURTZ,'
HE
SAID,
YOUTH
FULLY
SOLEMN
AND
REPROACHFUL.
I
HELD
MY
TONGUE
AFTER
THAT.
IT
APPEARS
HE
HAD
PERSUADED
A
DUTCH
TRADING-
HOUSE
ON
THE
COAST
TO
FIT
HIM
OUT
WITH
STORES
AND
GOODS,
AND
HAD
STARTED
FOR
THE
INTERIOR
WITH
A
LIGHT
HEART
AND
NO
MORE
IDEA
OF
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
TO
HIM
THAN
A
BABY.
HE
HAD
BEEN
WANDERING
ABOUT
THAT
RIVER
FOR
NEARLY
TWO
YEARS
ALONE,
CUT
OFF
FROM
EVERYBODY
AND
EVERYTHING.
'I
AM
NOT
SO
YOUNG
AS
I
LOOK.
I
AM
TWENTY-
FIVE,'
HE
SAID.
'AT
FIRST
OLD
VAN
SHUYTEN
WOULD
TELL
ME
TO
GO
TO
THE
DEVIL,'
HE
NARRATED
WITH
KEEN
ENJOYMENT;
'BUT
I
STUCK
TO
HIM,
AND
TALKED
AND
TALKED,
TILL
AT
LAST
HE
GOT
AFRAID
I
WOULD
TALK
THE
HIND-LEG
OFF
HIS
FAVOUR-
ITE
DOG,
SO
HE
GAVE
ME
SOME
CHEAP
THINGS
AND
A
FEW
GUNS,
AND
TOLD
ME
HE
HOPED
HE
WOULD
NEVER
SEE
MY
FACE
AGAIN.
GOOD
OLD
DUTCHMAN,
VAN
SHUYTEN.
I'VE
SENT
HIM
ONE
SMALL
LOT
OF
IVORY
A
YEAR
AGO,
SO
THAT
HE
CAN'T
CALL
ME
A
LITTLE
THIEF
WHEN
I
GET
BACK.
I
HOPE
HE
GOT
IT.
AND
FOR
THE
REST
I
DON'T
CARE.
I
HAD
SOME
WOOD
STACKED
FOR
YOU.
THAT
WAS
MY
OLD
HOUSE.
DID
YOU
SEE?'


"I
GAVE
HIM
TOWSON'S
BOOK.
HE
MADE
AS
THOUGH
HE
WOULD
KISS
ME,
BUT
RESTRAINED
HIMSELF.
'THE
ONLY
BOOK
I
HAD
LEFT,
AND
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
LOST
IT,'
HE
SAID,
LOOKING
AT
IT
ECSTATICALLY.
'SO
MANY
ACCIDENTS
HAPPEN
TO
A
MAN
GOING
ABOUT
ALONE,
YOU
KNOW.
CANOES
GET
UPSET
SOME-
TIMES
--
AND
SOMETIMES
YOU'VE
GOT
TO
CLEAR
OUT
SO
QUICK
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
GET
ANGRY.'
HE
THUMBED
THE
PAGES.
'YOU
MADE
NOTES
IN
RUSSIAN?'
I
ASKED.
HE
NODDED.
'I
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
WRITTEN
IN
CIPHER,'
I
SAID.
HE
LAUGHED,
THEN
BECAME
SERIOUS.
'I
HAD
LOTS
OF
TROUBLE
TO
KEEP
THESE
PEOPLE
OFF,'
HE
SAID.
'DID
THEY
WANT
TO
KILL
YOU?'
I
ASKED.
'OH,
NO!'
HE
CRIED,
AND
CHECKED
HIMSELF.
'WHY
DID
THEY
ATTACK
US?'
I
PURSUED.
HE
HESITATED,
THEN
SAID
SHAMEFACEDLY,
'THEY
DON'T
WANT
HIM
TO
GO.'
'DON'T
THEY?'
I
SAID
CURIOUSLY.
HE
NODDED
A
NOD
FULL
OF
MYSTERY
AND
WISDOM.
'I
TELL
YOU,'
HE
CRIED,
'THIS
MAN
HAS
ENLARGED
MY
MIND.'
HE
OPENED
HIS
ARMS
WIDE,
STARING
AT
ME
WITH
HIS
LITTLE
BLUE
EYES
THAT
WERE
PERFECTLY
ROUND."

"I
LOOKED
AT
HIM,
LOST
IN
ASTONISHMENT.
THERE
HE
WAS
BEFORE
ME,
IN
MOTLEY,
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
ABSCONDED
FROM
A
TROUPE
OF
MIMES,
ENTHUSIASTIC,
FABULOUS.
HIS
VERY
EXISTENCE
WAS
IMPROBABLE,
INEXPLICABLE,
AND
ALTO-
GETHER
BEWILDERING.
HE
WAS
AN
INSOLUBLE
PROBLEM.
IT
WAS
INCONCEIVABLE
HOW
HE
HAD
EXISTED,
HOW
HE
HAD
SUCCEEDED
IN
GETTING
SO
FAR,
HOW
HE
HAD
MANAGED
TO
REMAIN
--
WHY
HE
DID
NOT
INSTANTLY
DISAPPEAR.
'I
WENT
A
LITTLE
FARTHER,'
HE
SAID,
'THEN
STILL
A
LITTLE
FARTHER
--
TILL
I
HAD
GONE
SO
FAR
THAT
I
DON'T
KNOW
HOW
I'LL
EVER
GET
BACK.
NEVER
MIND.
PLENTY
TIME.
I
CAN
MANAGE.
YOU
TAKE
KURTZ
AWAY
QUICK
--
QUICK
--
I
TELL
YOU.'
THE
GLAMOUR
OF
YOUTH
ENVELOPED
HIS
PARTI-COLOURED
RAGS,
HIS
DESTITUTION,
HIS
LONELINESS,
THE
ESSENTIAL
DESOLATION
OF
HIS
FUTILE
WANDERINGS.
FOR
MONTHS
--
FOR
YEARS
--
HIS
LIFE
HADN'T
BEEN
WORTH
A
DAY'S
PURCHASE;
AND
THERE
HE
WAS
GALLANTLY,
THOUGHTLESSLY
ALIVE,
TO
ALL
APPEARANCE
INDESTRUCTIBLE
SOLELY
BY
THE
VIRTUE
OF
HIS
FEW
YEARS
AND
OF
HIS
UNREFLECTING
AUDACITY.
I
WAS
SEDUCED
INTO
SOME-
THING
LIKE
ADMIRATION
--
LIKE
ENVY.
GLAMOUR
URGED
HIM
ON,
GLAMOUR
KEPT
HIM
UNSCATHED.
HE
SURELY
WANTED
NOTHING
FROM
THE
WILDERNESS
BUT
SPACE
TO
BREATHE
IN
AND
TO
PUSH
ON
THROUGH.
HIS
NEED
WAS
TO
EXIST,
AND
TO
MOVE
ONWARDS
AT
THE
GREATEST
POSSIBLE
RISK,
AND
WITH
A
MAXIMUM
OF
PRIVATION.
IF
THE
ABSOLUTELY
PURE,
UN-
CALCULATING,
UNPRACTICAL
SPIRIT
OF
ADVENTURE
HAD
EVER
RULED
A
HUMAN
BEING,
IT
RULED
THIS
BEPATCHED
YOUTH.
I
ALMOST
ENVIED
HIM
THE
POSSESSION
OF
THIS
MODEST
AND
CLEAR
FLAME.
IT
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
CONSUMED
ALL
THOUGHT
OF
SELF
SO
COMPLETELY,
THAT
EVEN
WHILE
HE
WAS
TALKING
TO
YOU,
YOU
FORGOT
THAT
IT
WAS
HE
--
THE
MAN
BEFORE
YOUR
EYES
--
WHO
HAD
GONE
THROUGH
THESE
THINGS.
I
DID
NOT
ENVY
HIM
HIS
DEVOTION
TO
KURTZ,
THOUGH.
HE
HAD
NOT
MEDITATED
OVER
IT.
IT
CAME
TO
HIM,
AND
HE
AC-
CEPTED
IT
WITH
A
SORT
OF
EAGER
FATALISM.
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
TO
ME
IT
APPEARED
ABOUT
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
THING
IN
EVERY
WAY
HE
HAD
COME
UPON
SO
FAR.


"THEY
HAD
COME
TOGETHER
UNAVOIDABLY,
LIKE
TWO
SHIPS
BECALMED
NEAR
EACH
OTHER,
AND
LAY
RUBBING
SIDES
AT
LAST.
I
SUPPOSE
KURTZ
WANTED
AN
AUDIENCE,
BECAUSE
ON
A
CERTAIN
OCCASION,
WHEN
ENCAMPED
IN
THE
FOREST,
THEY
HAD
TALKED
ALL
NIGHT,
OR
MORE
PROBABLY
KURTZ
HAD
TALKED.
'WE
TALKED
OF
EVERYTHING,'
HE
SAID,
QUITE
TRANSPORTED
AT
THE
RECOLLECTION.
'I
FORGOT
THERE
WAS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
SLEEP.
THE
NIGHT
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
LAST
AN
HOUR.
EVERYTHING!
EVERYTHING!
.
.
.
OF
LOVE,
TOO.'
'AH,
HE
TALKED
TO
YOU
OF
LOVE!'
I
SAID,
MUCH
AMUSED.
'IT
ISN'T
WHAT
YOU
THINK,'
HE
CRIED,
ALMOST
PASSIONATELY.
'IT
WAS
IN
GENERAL.
HE
MADE
ME
SEE
THINGS
--
THINGS.'


"HE
THREW
HIS
ARMS
UP.
WE
WERE
ON
DECK
AT
THE
TIME,
AND
THE
HEADMAN
OF
MY
WOOD
CUTTERS,
LOUNGING
NEAR
BY,
TURNED
UPON
HIM
HIS
HEAVY
AND
GLITTERING
EYES.
I
LOOKED
AROUND,
AND
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHY,
BUT
I
ASSURE
YOU
THAT
NEVER,
NEVER
BEFORE,
DID
THIS
LAND,
THIS
RIVER,
THIS
JUNGLE,
THE
VERY
ARCH
OF
THIS
BLAZING
SKY,
APPEAR
TO
ME
SO
HOPELESS
AND
SO
DARK,
SO
IMPENE-
TRABLE
TO
HUMAN
THOUGHT,
SO
PITILESS
TO
HUMAN
WEAK-
NESS.
'AND,
EVER
SINCE,
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
HIM,
OF
COURSE?'
I
SAID.


"ON
THE
CONTRARY.
IT
APPEARS
THEIR
INTERCOURSE
HAD
BEEN
VERY
MUCH
BROKEN
BY
VARIOUS
CAUSES.
HE
HAD,
AS
HE
INFORMED
ME
PROUDLY,
MANAGED
TO
NURSE
KURTZ
THROUGH
TWO
ILLNESSES
(HE
ALLUDED
TO
IT
AS
YOU
WOULD
TO
SOME
RISKY
FEAT),
BUT
AS
A
RULE
KURTZ
WANDERED
ALONE,
FAR
IN
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
FOREST.
'VERY
OFTEN
COMING
TO
THIS
STATION,
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
DAYS
AND
DAYS
BEFORE
HE
WOULD
TURN
UP,'
HE
SAID.
'AH,
IT
WAS
WORTH
WAITING
FOR!
--
SOMETIMES.'
'WHAT
WAS
HE
DOING?
EX-
PLORING
OR
WHAT?'
I
ASKED.
'OH,
YES,
OF
COURSE',
HE
HAD
DISCOVERED
LOTS
OF
VILLAGES,
A
LAKE,
TOO
--
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
EXACTLY
IN
WHAT
DIRECTION;
IT
WAS
DANGEROUS
TO
INQUIRE
TOO
MUCH
--
BUT
MOSTLY
HIS
EXPEDITIONS
HAD
BEEN
FOR
IVORY.
'BUT
HE
HAD
NO
GOODS
TO
TRADE
WITH
BY
THAT
TIME,'
I
OBJECTED.
'THERE'S
A
GOOD
LOT
OF
CARTRIDGES
LEFT
EVEN
YET,'
HE
ANSWERED,
LOOKING
AWAY.
'TO
SPEAK
PLAINLY,
HE
RAIDED
THE
COUNTRY,'
I
SAID.
HE
NODDED.
'NOT
ALONE,
SURELY!'
HE
MUTTERED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
VILLAGES
ROUND
THAT
LAKE.
'KURTZ
GOT
THE
TRIBE
TO
FOLLOW
HIM,
DID
HE?'
I
SUGGESTED.
HE
FIDGETED
A
LITTLE.
'THEY
ADORED
HIM,'
HE
SAID.
THE
TONE
OF
THESE
WORDS
WAS
SO
EXTRAORDINARY
THAT
I
LOOKED
AT
HIM
SEARCHINGLY.
IT
WAS
CURIOUS
TO
SEE
HIS
MINGLED
EAGERNESS
AND
RELUC-
TANCE
TO
SPEAK
OF
KURTZ.
THE
MAN
FILLED
HIS
LIFE,
OCCU-
PIED
HIS
THOUGHTS,
SWAYED
HIS
EMOTIONS.
'WHAT
CAN
YOU
EXPECT?'
HE
BURST
OUT;
'HE
CAME
TO
THEM
WITH
THUNDER
AND
LIGHTNING,
YOU
KNOW
--
AND
THEY
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
ANYTHING
LIKE
IT
--
AND
VERY
TERRIBLE.
HE
COULD
BE
VERY
TERRIBLE.
YOU
CAN'T
JUDGE
MR.
KURTZ
AS
YOU
WOULD
AN
ORDINARY
MAN.
NO,
NO,
NO!
NOW
--
JUST
TO
GIVE
YOU
AN
IDEA
--
I
DON'T
MIND
TELLING
YOU,
HE
WANTED
TO
SHOOT
ME,
TOO,
ONE
DAY
--
BUT
I
DON'T
JUDGE
HIM.'
'SHOOT
YOU!'
I
CRIED
'WHAT
FOR?'
'WELL,
I
HAD
A
SMALL
LOT
OF
IVORY
THE
CHIEF
OF
THAT
VILLAGE
NEAR
MY
HOUSE
GAVE
ME.
YOU
SEE
I
USED
TO
SHOOT
GAME
FOR
THEM.
WELL,
HE
WANTED
IT,
AND
WOULDN'T
HEAR
REASON.
HE
DECLARED
HE
WOULD
SHOOT
ME
UNLESS
I
GAVE
HIM
THE
IVORY
AND
THEN
CLEARED
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY,
BECAUSE
HE
COULD
DO
SO,
AND
HAD
A
FANCY
FOR
IT,
AND
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
ON
EARTH
TO
PREVENT
HIM
KILLING
WHOM
HE
JOLLY
WELL
PLEASED.
AND
IT
WAS
TRUE,
TOO.
I
GAVE
HIM
THE
IVORY.
WHAT
DID
I
CARE!
BUT
I
DIDN'T
CLEAR
OUT.
NO,
NO.
I
COULDN'T
LEAVE
HIM.
I
HAD
TO
BE
CAREFUL,
OF
COURSE,
TILL
WE
GOT
FRIENDLY
AGAIN
FOR
A
TIME.
HE
HAD
HIS
SECOND
ILLNESS
THEN.
AFTERWARDS
I
HAD
TO
KEEP
OUT
OF
THE
WAY;
BUT
I
DIDN'T
MIND.
HE
WAS
LIVING
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
IN
THOSE
VILLAGES
ON
THE
LAKE.
WHEN
HE
CAME
DOWN
TO
THE
RIVER,
SOMETIMES
HE
WOULD
TAKE
TO
ME,
AND
SOMETIMES
IT
WAS
BETTER
FOR
ME
TO
BE
CAREFUL.
THIS
MAN
SUFFERED
TOO
MUCH.
HE
HATED
ALL
THIS,
AND
SOMEHOW
HE
COULDN'T
GET
AWAY.
WHEN
I
HAD
A
CHANCE
I
BEGGED
HIM
TO
TRY
AND
LEAVE
WHILE
THERE
WAS
TIME;
I
OFFERED
TO
GO
BACK
WITH
HIM.
AND
HE
WOULD
SAY
YES,
AND
THEN
HE
WOULD
REMAIN;
GO
OFF
ON
ANOTHER
IVORY
HUNT;
DISAPPEAR
FOR
WEEKS;
FORGET
HIMSELF
AMONGST
THESE
PEOPLE
--
FORGET
HIMSELF
--
YOU
KNOW.'
'WHY!
HE'S
MAD,'
I
SAID.
HE
PROTESTED
INDIGNANTLY.
MR.
KURTZ
COULDN'T
BE
MAD.
IF
I
HAD
HEARD
HIM
TALK,
ONLY
TWO
DAYS
AGO,
I
WOULDN'T
DARE
HINT
AT
SUCH
A
THING.
.
.
.
I
HAD
TAKEN
UP
MY
BINOCULARS
WHILE
WE
TALKED,
AND
WAS
LOOKING
AT
THE
SHORE,
SWEEPING
THE
LIMIT
OF
THE
FOREST
AT
EACH
SIDE
AND
AT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
HOUSE.
THE
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
THERE
BEING
PEOPLE
IN
THAT
BUSH,
SO
SILENT,
SO
QUIET
--
AS
SILENT
AND
QUIET
AS
THE
RUINED
HOUSE
ON
THE
HILL
--
MADE
ME
UNEASY.
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGN
ON
THE
FACE
OF
NATURE
OF
THIS
AMAZING
TALE
THAT
WAS
NOT
SO
MUCH
TOLD
AS
SUGGESTED
TO
ME
IN
DESOLATE
EXCLAMATIONS,
COMPLETED
BY
SHRUGS,
IN
INTERRUPTED
PHRASES,
IN
HINTS
ENDING
IN
DEEP
SIGHS.
THE
WOODS
WERE
UNMOVED,
LIKE
A
MASK
--
HEAVY,
LIKE
THE
CLOSED
DOOR
OF
A
PRISON
--
THEY
LOOKED
WITH
THEIR
AIR
OF
HIDDEN
KNOWLEDGE,
OF
PATIENT
EXPECTATION,
OF
UNAPPROACHABLE
SILENCE.
THE
RUSSIAN
WAS
EXPLAINING
TO
ME
THAT
IT
WAS
ONLY
LATELY
THAT
MR.
KURTZ
HAD
COME
DOWN
TO
THE
RIVER,
BRINGING
ALONG
WITH
HIM
ALL
THE
FIGHTING
MEN
OF
THAT
LAKE
TRIBE.
HE
HAD
BEEN
ABSENT
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
--
GETTING
HIMSELF
ADORED,
I
SUPPOSE
--
AND
HAD
COME
DOWN
UNEXPECTEDLY,
WITH
THE
INTENTION
TO
ALL
APPEARANCE
OF
MAKING
A
RAID
EITHER
ACROSS
THE
RIVER
OR
DOWN
STREAM.
EVIDENTLY
THE
APPETITE
FOR
MORE
IVORY
HAD
GOT
THE
BETTER
OF
THE
--
WHAT
SHALL
I
SAY?
--
LESS
MATERIAL
ASPIRATIONS.
HOWEVER
HE
HAD
GOT
MUCH
WORSE
SUDDENLY.
'I
HEARD
HE
WAS
LYING
HELPLESS,
AND
SO
I
CAME
UP
--
TOOK
MY
CHANCE,'
SAID
THE
RUSSIAN.
'OH,
HE
IS
BAD,
VERY
BAD.'
I
DIRECTED
MY
GLASS
TO
THE
HOUSE.
THERE
WERE
NO
SIGNS
OF
LIFE,
BUT
THERE
WAS
THE
RUINED
ROOF,
THE
LONG
MUD
WALL
PEEPING
ABOVE
THE
GRASS,
WITH
THREE
LITTLE
SQUARE
WINDOW-HOLES,
NO
TWO
OF
THE
SAME
SIZE;
ALL
THIS
BROUGHT
WITHIN
REACH
OF
MY
HAND,
AS
IT
WERE.
AND
THEN
I
MADE
A
BRUSQUE
MOVEMENT,
AND
ONE
OF
THE
REMAINING
POSTS
OF
THAT
VANISHED
FENCE
LEAPED
UP
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
MY
GLASS.
YOU
REMEMBER
I
TOLD
YOU
I
HAD
BEEN
STRUCK
AT
THE
DISTANCE
BY
CERTAIN
ATTEMPTS
AT
ORNAMENTATION,
RATHER
REMARKABLE
IN
THE
RUINOUS
ASPECT
OF
THE
PLACE.
NOW
I
HAD
SUDDENLY
A
NEARER
VIEW,
AND
ITS
FIRST
RESULT
WAS
TO
MAKE
ME
THROW
MY
HEAD
BACK
AS
IF
BEFORE
A
BLOW.
THEN
I
WENT
CARE-
FULLY
FROM
POST
TO
POST
WITH
MY
GLASS,
AND
I
SAW
MY
MISTAKE.
THESE
ROUND
KNOBS
WERE
NOT
ORNAMENTAL
BUT
SYMBOLIC;
THEY
WERE
EXPRESSIVE
AND
PUZZLING,
STRIKING
AND
DISTURBING
--
FOOD
FOR
THOUGHT
AND
ALSO
FOR
VUL-
TURES
IF
THERE
HAD
BEEN
ANY
LOOKING
DOWN
FROM
THE
SKY;
BUT
AT
ALL
EVENTS
FOR
SUCH
ANTS
AS
WERE
INDUSTRIOUS
ENOUGH
TO
ASCEND
THE
POLE.
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EVEN
MORE
IMPRESSIVE,
THOSE
HEADS
ON
THE
STAKES,
IF
THEIR
FACES
HAD
NOT
BEEN
TURNED
TO
THE
HOUSE.
ONLY
ONE,
THE
FIRST
I
HAD
MADE
OUT,
WAS
FACING
MY
WAY.
I
WAS
NOT
SO
SHOCKED
AS
YOU
MAY
THINK.
THE
START
BACK
I
HAD
GIVEN
WAS
REALLY
NOTHING
BUT
A
MOVEMENT
OF
SURPRISE.
I
HAD
EXPECTED
TO
SEE
A
KNOB
OF
WOOD
THERE,
YOU
KNOW.
I
RETURNED
DELIBERATELY
TO
THE
FIRST
I
HAD
SEEN
--
AND
THERE
IT
WAS,
BLACK,
DRIED,
SUNKEN,
WITH
DOSED
EYELIDS
--
A
HEAD
THAT
SEEMED
TO
SLEEP
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THAT
POLE,
AND,
WITH
THE
SHRUNKEN
DRY
LIPS
SHOWING
A
NARROW
WHITE
LINE
OF
THE
TEETH,
WAS
SMILING,
TOO,
SMILING
CONTINUOUSLY
AT
SOME
ENDLESS
AND
JOCOSE
DREAM
OF
THAT
ETERNAL
SLUMBER.


"I
AM
NOT
DISCLOSING
ANY
TRADE
SECRETS.
IN
FACT,
THE
MANAGER
SAID
AFTERWARDS
THAT
MR.
KURTZ'S
METHODS
HAD
RUINED
THE
DISTRICT.
I
HAVE
NO
OPINION
ON
THAT
POINT,
BUT
I
WANT
YOU
CLEARLY
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
EXACTLY
PROFITABLE
IN
THESE
HEADS
BEING
THERE.
THEY
ONLY
SHOWED
THAT
MR.
KURTZ
LACKED
RE-
STRAINT
IN
THE
GRATIFICATION
OF
HIS
VARIOUS
LUSTS,
THAT
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
WANTING
IN
HIM
--
SOME
SMALL
MATTER
WHICH,
WHEN
THE
PRESSING
NEED
AROSE,
COULD
NOT
BE
FOUND
UNDER
HIS
MAGNIFICENT
ELOQUENCE.
WHETHER
HE
KNEW
OF
HIS
DEFICIENCY
HIMSELF
I
CAN'T
SAY.
I
THINK
THE
KNOWLEDGE
CAME
TO
HIM
AT
LAST
--
ONLY
AT
THE
VERY
LAST.
BUT
THE
WILDERNESS
HAD
FOUND
HIM
OUT
EARLY,
AND
HAD
TAKEN
ON
HIM
A
TERRIBLE
VENGEANCE
FOR
THE
FANTASTIC
INVASION.
I
THINK
IT
HAD
WHISPERED
TO
HIM
THINGS
ABOUT
HIMSELF
WHICH
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW,
THINGS
OF
WHICH
HE
HAD
NO
CONCEPTION
TILL
HE
TOOK
COUNSEL
WITH
THIS
GREAT
SOLITUDE
--
AND
THE
WHISPER
HAD
PROVED
IRRESISTIBLY
FAS-
CINATING.
IT
ECHOED
LOUDLY
WITHIN
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
HOLLOW
AT
THE
CORE....
I
PUT
DOWN
THE
GLASS,
AND
THE
HEAD
THAT
HAD
APPEARED
NEAR
ENOUGH
TO
BE
SPOKEN
TO
SEEMED
AT
ONCE
TO
HAVE
LEAPED
AWAY
FROM
ME
INTO
INACCESSIBLE
DISTANCE.


"THE
ADMIRER
OF
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
A
BIT
CRESTFALLEN.
IN
A
HURRIED,
INDISTINCT
VOICE
HE
BEGAN
TO
ASSURE
ME
HE
HAD
NOT
DARED
TO
TAKE
THESE
--
SAY,
SYMBOLS
--
DOWN.
HE
WAS
NOT
AFRAID
OF
THE
NATIVES;
THEY
WOULD
NOT
STIR
TILL
MR.
KURTZ
GAVE
THE
WORD.
HIS
ASCENDANCY
WAS
EXTRAOR-
DINARY.
THE
CAMPS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
SURROUNDED
THE
PLACE,
AND
THE
CHIEFS
CAME
EVERY
DAY
TO
SEE
HIM.
THEY
WOULD
CRAWL....
'I
DON'T
WANT
TO
KNOW
ANYTHING
OF
THE
CEREMONIES
USED
WHEN
APPROACHING
MR.
KURTZ,'
I
SHOUTED.
CURIOUS,
THIS
FEELING
THAT
CAME
OVER
ME
THAT
SUCH
DETAILS
WOULD
BE
MORE
INTOLERABLE
THAN
THOSE
HEADS
DRYING
ON
THE
STAKES
UNDER
MR.
KURTZ'S
WINDOWS.
AFTER
A]L,
THAT
WAS
ONLY
A
SAVAGE
SIGHT,
WHILE
I
SEEMED
AT
ONE
BOUND
TO
HAVE
BEEN
TRANSPORTED
INTO
SOME
LIGHTLESS
REGION
OF
SUBTLE
HORRORS,
WHERE
PURE,
UNCOMPLICATED
SAVAGERY
WAS
A
POSITIVE
RELIEF,
BEING
SOMETHING
THAT
HAD
A
RIGHT
TO
EXIST
--
OBVIOUSLY
--
IN
THE
SUNSHINE.
THE
YOUNG
MAN
LOOKED
AT
ME
WITH
SURPRISE.
I
SUPPOSE
IT
DID
NOT
OCCUR
TO
HIM
THAT
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
NO
IDOL
OF
MINE.
HE
FORGOT
I
HADN'T
HEARD
ANY
OF
THESE
SPLENDID
MONOLOGUES
ON,
WHAT
WAS
IT?
ON
LOVE,
JUS-
TICE,
CONDUCT
OF
LIFE
--
OR
WHAT
NOT.
IF
IT
HAD
COME
TO
CRAWLING
BEFORE
MR.
KURTZ,
HE
CRAWLED
AS
MUCH
AS
THE
VERIEST
SAVAGE
OF
THEM
ALL.
I
HAD
NO
IDEA
OF
THE
CONDI-
TIONS,
HE
SAID:
THESE
HEADS
WERE
THE
HEADS
OF
REBELS.
I
SHOCKED
HIM
EXCESSIVELY
BY
LAUGHING.
REBELS!
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
NEXT
DEFINITION
I
WAS
TO
HEAR?
THERE
HAD
BEEN
ENEMIES,
CRIMINALS,
WORKERS
--
AND
THESE
WERE
REBELS.
THOSE
REBELLIOUS
HEADS
LOOKED
VERY
SUBDUED
TO
ME
ON
THEIR
STICKS.
'YOU
DON'T
KNOW
HOW
SUCH
A
LIFE
TRIES
A
MAN
LIKE
KURTZ,'
CRIED
KURTZ'S
LAST
DISCIPLE.
'WELL,
AND
YOU?'
I
SAID.
'I!
I!
I
AM
A
SIMPLE
MAN.
I
HAVE
NO
GREAT
THOUGHTS.
I
WANT
NOTHING
FROM
ANYBODY.
HOW
CAN
YOU
COMPARE
ME
TO
.
.
.
?'
HIS
FEELINGS
WERE
TOO
MUCH
FOR
SPEECH,
AND
SUDDENLY
HE
BROKE
DOWN.
'I
DON'T
UNDERSTAND,'
HE
GROANED.
'I'VE
BEEN
DOING
MY
BEST
TO
KEEP
HIM
ALIVE,
AND
THAT'S
ENOUGH.
I
HAD
NO
HAND
IN
ALL
THIS.
I
HAVE
NO
ABILITIES.
THERE
HASN'T
BEEN
A
DROP
OF
MEDICINE
OR
A
MOUTHFUL
OF
IN-
VALID
FOOD
FOR
MONTHS
HERE.
HE
WAS
SHAMEFULLY
ABAN-
DONED.
A
MAN
LIKE
THIS,
WITH
SUCH
IDEAS.
SHAMEFULLY!
SHAMEFULLY!
I
--
I
--
HAVEN'T
SLEPT
FOR
THE
LAST
TEN
NIGHTS
.
.
.'


"HIS
VOICE
LOST
ITSELF
IN
THE
CALM
OF
THE
EVENING.
THE
LONG
SHADOWS
OF
THE
FOREST
HAD
SLIPPED
DOWNHILL
WHILE
WE
TALKED,
HAD
GONE
FAR
BEYOND
THE
RUINED
HOVEL,
BEYOND
THE
SYMBOLIC
ROW
OF
STAKES.
ALL
THIS
WAS
IN
THE
GLOOM,
WHILE
WE
DOWN
THERE
WERE
YET
IN
THE
SUNSHINE,
AND
THE
STRETCH
OF
THE
RIVER
ABREAST
OF
THE
CLEARING
GLITTERED
IN
A
STILL
AND
DAZZLING
SPLENDOUR,
WITH
A
MURKY
AND
OVERSHADOWED
BEND
ABOVE
AND
BELOW.
NOT
A
LIVING
SOUL
WAS
SEEN
ON
THE
SHORE.
THE
BUSHES
DID
NOT
RUSTLE.


"SUDDENLY
ROUND
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
HOUSE
A
GROUP
OF
MEN
APPEARED,
AS
THOUGH
THEY
HAD
COME
UP
FROM
THE
GROUND.
THEY
WADED
WAIST-DEEP
IN
THE
GRASS,
IN
A
COMPACT
BODY,
BEARING
AN
IMPROVISED
STRETCHER
IN
THEIR
MIDST.
INSTANTLY,
IN
THE
EMPTINESS
OF
THE
LANDSCAPE,
A
CRY
AROSE
WHOSE
SHRILLNESS
PIERCED
THE
STILL
AIR
LIKE
A
SHARP
ARROW
FLYING
STRAIGHT
TO
THE
VERY
HEART
OF
THE
LAND;
AND,
AS
IF
BY
ENCHANTMENT,
STREAMS
OF
HUMAN
BEINGS
--
OF
NAKED
HUMAN
BEINGS
--
WITH
SPEARS
IN
THEIR
HANDS,
WITH
BOWS,
WITH
SHIELDS,
WITH
WILD
GLANCES
AND
SAVAGE
MOVEMENTS,
WERE
POURED
INTO
THE
DEARING
BY
THE
DARK-FACED
AND
PENSIVE
FOREST.
THE
BUSHES
SHOOK,
THE
GRASS
SWAYED
FOR
A
TIME,
AND
THEN
EVERYTHING
STOOD
STILL
IN
ATTENTIVE
IMMOBILITY.


"
'NOW,
IF
HE
DOES
NOT
SAY
THE
RIGHT
THING
TO
THEM
WE
ARE
ALL
DONE
FOR,'
SAID
THE
RUSSIAN
AT
MY
ELBOW.
THE
KNOT
OF
MEN
WITH
THE
STRETCHER
HAD
STOPPED,
TOO,
HALFWAY
TO
THE
STEAMER,
AS
IF
PETRIFIED.
I
SAW
THE
MAN
ON
THE
STRETCHER
SIT
UP,
LANK
AND
WITH
AN
UPLIFTED
ARM,
ABOVE
THE
SHOULDERS
OF
THE
BEARERS.
'LET
US
HOPE
THAT
THE
MAN
WHO
CAN
TALK
SO
WELL
OF
LOVE
IN
GENERAL
WILL
FIND
SOME
PARTICULAR
REASON
TO
SPARE
US
THIS
TIME,'
I
SAID.
I
RESENTED
BITTERLY
THE
ABSURD
DANGER
OF
OUR
SITU-
ATION,
AS
IF
TO
BE
AT
THE
MERCY
OF
THAT
ATROCIOUS
PHAN-
TOM
HAD
BEEN
A
DISHONOURING
NECESSITY.
I
COULD
NOT
HEAR
A
SOUND,
BUT
THROUGH
MY
GLASSES
I
SAW
THE
THIN
ARM
EXTENDED
COMMANDINGLY,
THE
LOWER
JAW
MOVING,
THE
EYES
OF
THAT
APPARITION
SHINING
DARKLY
FAR
IN
ITS
BONY
HEAD
THAT
NODDED
WITH
GROTESQUE
JERKS.
KURTZ
--
KURTZ
--
THAT
MEANS
SHORT
IN
GERMAN
--
DON'T
IT?
WELL,
THE
NAME
WAS
AS
TRUE
AS
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IN
HIS
LIFE
--
AND
DEATH.
HE
LOOKED
AT
LEAST
SEVEN
FEET
LONG.
HIS
COVERING
HAD
FALLEN
OFF,
AND
HIS
BODY
EMERGED
FROM
IT
PITIFUL
AND
APPALLING
AS
FROM
A
WINDING-SHEET.
I
COULD
SEE
THE
CAGE
OF
HIS
RIBS
ALL
ASTIR,
THE
BONES
OF
HIS
ARM
WAVING.
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
AN
ANIMATED
IMAGE
OF
DEATH
CARVED
OUT
OF
OLD
IVORY
HAD
BEEN
SHAKING
ITS
HAND
WITH
MENACES
AT
A
MOTIONLESS
CROWD
OF
MEN
MADE
OF
DARK
AND
GLITTERING
BRONZE.
I
SAW
HIM
OPEN
HIS
MOUTH
WIDE
--
IT
GAVE
HIM
A
WEIRDLY
VORACIOUS
ASPECT,
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
WANTED
TO
SWALLOW
ALL
THE
AIR,
ALL
THE
EARTH,
ALL
THE
MEN
BEFORE
HIM.
A
DEEP
VOICE
REACHED
ME
FAINTLY.
HE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
SHOUTING.
HE
FELL
BACK
SUDDENLY.
THE
STRETCHER
SHOOK
AS
THE
BEARERS
STAGGERED
FORWARD
AGAIN,
AND
ALMOST
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
NOTICED
THAT
THE
CROWD
OF
SAVAGES
WAS
VANISHING
WITHOUT
ANY
PERCEPTI-
BLE
MOVEMENT
OF
RETREAT,
AS
IF
THE
FOREST
THAT
HAD
EJECTED
THESE
BEINGS
SO
SUDDENLY
HAD
DRAWN
THEM
IN
AGAIN
AS
THE
BREATH
IS
DRAWN
IN
A
LONG
ASPIRATION.


"SOME
OF
THE
PILGRIMS
BEHIND
THE
STRETCHER
CARRIED
HIS
ARMS
--
TWO
SHOT-GUNS,
A
HEAVY
RIFLE,
AND
A
LIGHT
REVOLVER-CARBINE
--
THE
THUNDERBOLTS
OF
THAT
PITIFUL
JUPITER.
THE
MANAGER
BENT
OVER
HIM
MURMURING
AS
HE
WALKED
BESIDE
HIS
HEAD.
THEY
LAID
HIM
DOWN
IN
ONE
OF
THE
LITTLE
CABINS
--
JUST
A
ROOM
FOR
A
BED
PLACE
AND
A
CAMP-STOOL
OR
TWO,
YOU
KNOW.
WE
HAD
BROUGHT
HIS
BELATED
CORRESPONDENCE,
AND
A
LOT
OF
TORN
ENVELOPES
AND
OPEN
LETTERS
LITTERED
HIS
BED.
HIS
HAND
ROAMED
FEEBLY
AMONGST
THESE
PAPERS.
I
WAS
STRUCK
BY
THE
FIRE
OF
HIS
EYES
AND
THE
COMPOSED
LANGUOR
OF
HIS
EXPRES-
SION.
IT
WAS
NOT
SO
MUCH
THE
EXHAUSTION
OF
DISEASE.
HE
DID
NOT
SEEM
IN
PAIN.
THIS
SHADOW
LOOKED
SATIATED
AND
CALM,
AS
THOUGH
FOR
THE
MOMENT
IT
HAD
HAD
ITS
FILL
OF
ALL
THE
EMOTIONS.


"HE
RUSTLED
ONE
OF
THE
LETTERS,
AND
LOOKING
STRAIGHT
IN
MY
FACE
SAID,
'I
AM
GLAD.'
SOMEBODY
HAD
BEEN
WRIT-
ING
TO
HIM
ABOUT
ME.
THESE
SPECIAL
RECOMMENDATIONS
WERE
TURNING
UP
AGAIN.
THE
VOLUME
OF
TONE
HE
EMITTED
WITHOUT
EFFORT,
ALMOST
WITHOUT
THE
TROUBLE
OF
MOVING
HIS
LIPS,
AMAZED
ME.
A
VOICE!
A
VOICE!
IT
WAS
GRAVE,
PROFOUND,
VIBRATING,
WHILE
THE
MAN
DID
NOT
SEEM
CAP-
ABLE
OF
A
WHISPER.
HOWEVER,
HE
HAD
ENOUGH
STRENGTH
IN
HIM
--
FACTITIOUS
NO
DOUBT
--
TO
VERY
NEARLY
MAKE
AN
END
OF
US,
AS
YOU
SHALL
HEAR
DIRECTLY.


"THE
MANAGER
APPEARED
SILENTLY
IN
THE
DOORWAY;
I
STEPPED
OUT
AT
ONCE
AND
HE
DREW
THE
CURTAIN
AFTER
ME.
THE
RUSSIAN,
EYED
CURIOUSLY
BY
THE
PILGRIMS,
WAS
STAR-
ING
AT
THE
SHORE.
I
FOLLOWED
THE
DIRECTION
OF
HIS
GLANCE.


"DARK
HUMAN
SHAPES
COULD
BE
MADE
OUT
IN
THE
DIS-
TANCE,
FLITTING
INDISTINCTLY
AGAINST
THE
GLOOMY
BORDER
OF
THE
FOREST,
AND
NEAR
THE
RIVER
TWO
BRONZE
FIGURES,
LEANING
ON
TALL
SPEARS,
STOOD
IN
THE
SUNLIGHT
UNDER
FAN-
TASTIC
HEAD-DRESSES
OF
SPOTTED
SKINS,
WARLIKE
AND
STILL
IN
STATUESQUE
REPOSE.
AND
FROM
RIGHT
TO
LEFT
ALONG
THE
LIGHTED
SHORE
MOVED
A
WILD
AND
GORGEOUS
APPARITION
OF
A
WOMAN.


"SHE
WALKED
WITH
MEASURED
STEPS,
DRAPED
IN
STRIPED
AND
FRINGED
CLOTHES,
TREADING
THE
EARTH
PROUDLY,
WITH
A
SLIGHT
JINGLE
AND
FLASH
OF
BARBAROUS
ORNAMENTS.
SHE
CARRIED
HER
HEAD
HIGH;
HER
HAIR
WAS
DONE
IN
THE
SHAPE
OF
A
HELMET;
SHE
HAD
BRASS
LEGGINGS
TO
THE
KNEE,
BRASS
WIRE
GAUNTLETS
TO
THE
ELBOW,
A
CRIMSON
SPOT
ON
HER
TAWNY
CHEEK,
INNUMERABLE
NECKLACES
OF
GLASS
BEADS
ON
HER
NECK;
BIZARRE
THINGS,
CHARMS,
GIFTS
OF
WITCH-MEN,
THAT
HUNG
ABOUT
HER,
GLITTERED
AND
TREMBLED
AT
EVERY
STEP.
SHE
MUST
HAVE
HAD
THE
VALUE
OF
SEVERAL
ELEPHANT
TUSKS
UPON
HER.
SHE
WAS
SAVAGE
AND
SUPERB,
WILD-EYED
AND
MAGNIFICENT;
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
OMINOUS
AND
STATELY
IN
HER
DELIBERATE
PROGRESS.
AND
IN
THE
HUSH
THAT
HAD
FALLEN
SUDDENLY
UPON
THE
WHOLE
SORROWFUL
LAND,
THE
IMMENSE
WILDERNESS,
THE
COLOSSAL
BODY
OF
THE
FECUND
AND
MYSTERIOUS
LIFE
SEEMED
TO
LOOK
AT
HER,
PENSIVE,
AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD
BEEN
LOOKING
AT
THE
IMAGE
OF
ITS
OWN
TENEBROUS
AND
PASSIONATE
SOUL.


"SHE
CAME
ABREAST
OF
THE
STEAMER,
STOOD
STILL,
AND
FACED
US.
HER
LONG
SHADOW
FELL
TO
THE
WATER'S
EDGE.
HER
FACE
HAD
A
TRAGIC
AND
FIERCE
ASPECT
OF
WILD
SORROW
AND
OF
DUMB
PAIN
MINGLED
WITH
THE
FEAR
OF
SOME
STRUGGLING,
HALF-SHAPED
RESOLVE.
SHE
STOOD
LOOKING
AT
US
WITHOUT
A
STIR,
AND
LIKE
THE
WILDERNESS
ITSELF,
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
BROODING
OVER
AN
INSCRUTABLE
PURPOSE.
A
WHOLE
MINUTE
PASSED,
AND
THEN
SHE
MADE
A
STEP
FORWARD.
THERE
WAS
A
LOW
JINGLE,
A
GLINT
OF
YELLOW
METAL,
A
SWAY
OF
FRINGED
DRAPERIES,
AND
SHE
STOPPED
AS
IF
HER
HEART
HAD
FAILED
HER.
THE
YOUNG
FELLOW
BY
MY
SIDE
GROWLED.
THE
PILGRIMS
MURMURED
AT
MY
BACK.
SHE
LOOKED
AT
US
ALL
AS
IF
HER
LIFE
HAD
DEPENDED
UPON
THE
UNSWERVING
STEADINESS
OF
HER
GLANCE.
SUDDENLY
SHE
OPENED
HER
BARED
ARMS
AND
THREW
THEM
UP
RIGID
ABOVE
HER
HEAD,
AS
THOUGH
IN
AN
UNCONTROLLABLE
DESIRE
TO
TOUCH
THE
SKY,
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
SWIFT
SHAD-
OWS
DARTED
OUT
ON
THE
EARTH,
SWEPT
AROUND
ON
THE
RIVER,
GATHERING
THE
STEAMER
INTO
A
SHADOWY
EMBRACE.
A
FORMIDABLE
SILENCE
HUNG
OVER
THE
SCENE.


"SHE
TURNED
AWAY
SLOWLY,
WALKED
ON,
FOLLOWING
THE
BANK,
AND
PASSED
INTO
THE
BUSHES
TO
THE
LEFT.
ONCE
ONLY
HER
EYES
GLEAMED
BACK
AT
US
IN
THE
DUSK
OF
THE
THICKETS
BEFORE
SHE
DISAPPEARED.


"
'IF
SHE
HAD
OFFERED
TO
COME
ABOARD
I
REALLY
THINK
I
WOULD
HAVE
TRIED
TO
SHOOT
HER,'
SAID
THE
MAN
OF
PATCHES,
NERVOUSLY.
'I
HAVE
BEEN
RISKING
MY
LIFE
EVERY
DAY
FOR
THE
LAST
FORTNIGHT
TO
KEEP
HER
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE.
SHE
GOT
IN
ONE
DAY
AND
KICKED
UP
A
ROW
ABOUT
THOSE
MISERABLE
RAGS
I
PICKED
UP
IN
THE
STOREROOM
TO
MEND
MY
CLOTHES
WITH.
I
WASN'T
DECENT.
AT
LEAST
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
THAT,
FOR
SHE
TALKED
LIKE
A
FURY
TO
KURTZ
FOR
AN
HOUR,
POINTING
AT
ME
NOW
AND
THEN.
I
DON'T
UNDER-
STAND
THE
DIALECT
OF
THIS
TRIBE.
LUCKILY
FOR
ME,
I
FANCY
KURTZ
FELT
TOO
ILL
THAT
DAY
TO
CARE,
OR
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MISCHIEF.
I
DON'T
UNDERSTAND....
NO
--
IT'S
TOO
MUCH
FOR
ME.
AH,
WELL,
IT'S
ALL
OVER
NOW.'


"AT
THIS
MOMENT
I
HEARD
KURTZ'S
DEEP
VOICE
BEHIND
THE
CURTAIN:
'SAVE
ME!
--
SAVE
THE
IVORY,
YOU
MEAN.
DON'T
TELL
ME.
SAVE
ME!
WHY,
I'VE
HAD
TO
SAVE
YOU.
YOU
ARE
INTERRUPTING
MY
PLANS
NOW.
SICK!
SICK!
NOT
SO
SICK
AS
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BELIEVE.
NEVER
MIND.
I'LL
CARRY
MY
IDEAS
OUT
YET
--
I
WILL
RETURN.
I'LL
SHOW
YOU
WHAT
CAN
BE
DONE.
YOU
WITH
YOUR
LITTLE
PEDDLING
NO-
TIONS
--
YOU
ARE
INTERFERING
WITH
ME.
I
WILL
RETURN.
I....'


"THE
MANAGER
CAME
OUT.
HE
DID
ME
THE
HONOUR
TO
TAKE
ME
UNDER
THE
ARM
AND
LEAD
ME
ASIDE.
'HE
IS
VERY
LOW,
VERY
LOW,'
HE
SAID.
HE
CONSIDERED
IT
NECESSARY
TO
SIGH,
BUT
NEGLECTED
TO
BE
CONSISTENTLY
SORROWFUL.
'WE
HAVE
DONE
ALL
WE
COULD
FOR
HIM
--
HAVEN'T
WE?
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
DISGUISING
THE
FACT,
MR.
KURTZ
HAS
DONE
MORE
HARM
THAN
GOOD
TO
THE
COMPANY.
HE
DID
NOT
SEE
THE
TIME
WAS
NOT
RIPE
FOR
VIGOROUS
ACTION.
CAU-
TIOUSLY,
CAUTIOUSLY
--
THAT'S
MY
PRINCIPLE.
WE
MUST
BE
CAUTIOUS
YET.
THE
DISTRICT
IS
CLOSED
TO
US
FOR
A
TIME.
DEPLORABLE!
UPON
THE
WHOLE,
THE
TRADE
WILL
SUFFER.
I
DON'T
DENY
THERE
IS
A
REMARKABLE
QUANTITY
OF
IVORY
--
MOSTLY
FOSSIL.
WE
MUST
SAVE
IT,
AT
ALL
EVENTS
--
BUT
LOOK
HOW
PRECARIOUS
THE
POSITION
IS
--
AND
WHY?
BECAUSE
THE
METHOD
IS
UNSOUND.'
'DO
YOU,'
SAID
I,
LOOKING
AT
THE
SHORE,
'CALL
IT
"UNSOUND
METHOD?"
'
'WITHOUT
DOUBT,'
HE
EXCLAIMED
HOTLY.
'DON'T
YOU?'
.
.
.
'NO
METHOD
AT
ALL,'
I
MURMURED
AFTER
A
WHILE.
'EXACTLY,'
HE
EXULTED.
'I
ANTICIPATED
THIS.
SHOWS
A
COMPLETE
WANT
OF
JUDG-
MENT.
IT
IS
MY
DUTY
TO
POINT
IT
OUT
IN
THE
PROPER
QUAR-
TER.'
'OH,'
SAID
I,
'THAT
FELLOW
--
WHAT'S
HIS
NAME?
--
THE
BRICKMAKER,
WILL
MAKE
A
READABLE
REPORT
FOR
YOU.'
HE
APPEARED
CONFOUNDED
FOR
A
MOMENT.
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
I
HAD
NEVER
BREATHED
AN
ATMOSPHERE
SO
VILE,
AND
I
TURNED
MENTALLY
TO
KURTZ
FOR
RELIEF
--
POSITIVELY
FOR
RELIEF.
'NEVERTHELESS
I
THINK
MR.
KURTZ
IS
A
REMARK-
ABLE
MAN,'
I
SAID
WITH
EMPHASIS.
HE
STARTED,
DROPPED
ON
ME
A
COLD
HEAVY
GLANCE,
SAID
VERY
QUIETLY,
'HE
WAS
AND
TURNED
HIS
BACK
ON
ME.
MY
HOUR
OF
FAVOUR
WAS
OVER;
I
FOUND
MYSELF
LUMPED
ALONG
WITH
KURTZ
AS
A
PARTISAN
OF
METHODS
FOR
WHICH
THE
TIME
WAS
NOT
RIPE:
I
WAS
UNSOUND!
AH!
BUT
IT
WAS
SOMETHING
TO
HAVE
AT
LEAST
A
CHOICE
OF
NIGHTMARES.


"I
HAD
TURNED
TO
THE
WILDERNESS
REALLY,
NOT
TO
MR.
KURTZ,
WHO,
I
WAS
READY
TO
ADMIT,
WAS
AS
GOOD
AS
BURIED.
AND
FOR
A
MOMENT
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
AS
IF
I
ALSO
WERE
BURIED
IN
A
VAST
GRAVE
FULL
OF
UNSPEAKABLE
SECRETS.
I
FELT
AN
INTOLERABLE
WEIGHT
OPPRESSING
MY
BREAST,
THE
SMELL
OF
THE
DAMP
EARTH,
THE
UNSEEN
PRESENCE
OF
VIC-
TORIOUS
CORRUPTION,
THE
DARKNESS
OF
AN
IMPENETRABLE
NIGHT....
THE
RUSSIAN
TAPPED
ME
ON
THE
SHOULDER.
I
HEARD
HIM
MUMBLING
AND
STAMMERING
SOMETHING
ABOUT
'BROTHER
SEAMAN
--
COULDN'T
CONCEAL
--
KNOWLEDGE
OF
MATTERS
THAT
WOULD
AFFECT
MR.
KURTZ'S
REPUTATION.'
I
WAITED.
FOR
HIM
EVIDENTLY
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
NOT
IN
HIS
GRAVE;
I
SUSPECT
THAT
FOR
HIM
MR.
KUUTZ
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
IMMORTALS.
'WELL!'
SAID
I
AT
LAST,
'SPEAK
OUT.
AS
IT
HAPPENS,
I
AM
MR.
KURTZ'S
FRIEND
--
IN
A
WAY.'



"HE
STATED
WITH
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
FORMALITY
THAT
HAD
WE
NOT
BEEN
'OF
THE
SAME
PROFESSION,'
HE
WOULD
HAVE
KEPT
THE
MATTER
TO
HIMSELF
WITHOUT
REGARD
TO
CONSE-
QUENCES.
'HE
SUSPECTED
THERE
WAS
AN
ACTIVE
ILL
WILL
TO-
WARDS
HIM
ON
THE
PART
OF
THESE
WHITE
MEN
THAT
--'
'YOU
ARE
RIGHT,'
I
SAID,
REMEMBERING
A
CERTAIN
CONVER-
SATION
I
HAD
OVERHEARD.
'THE
MANAGER
THINKS
YOU
OUGHT
TO
BE
HANGED.'
HE
SHOWED
A
CONCERN
AT
THIS
INTELLIGENCE
WHICH
AMUSED
ME
AT
FIRST.
'I
HAD
BETTER
GET
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
QUIETLY,'
HE
SAID
EARNESTLY.
'I
CAN
DO
NO
MORE
FOR
KURTZ
NOW,
AND
THEY
WOULD
SOON
FIND
SOME
EXCUSE.
WHAT'S
TO
STOP
THEM?
THERE'S
A
MILITARY
POST
THREE
HUNDRED
MILES
FROM
HERE.'
'WELL,
UPON
MY
WORD,'
SAID
I,
'PERHAPS
YOU
HAD
BETTER
GO
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
FRIENDS
AMONGST
THE
SAVAGES
NEAR
BY.'
'PLENTY,'
HE
SAID.
'THEY
ARE
SIMPLE
PEOPLE
--
AND
I
WANT
NOTHING,
YOU
KNOW.'
HE
STOOD
BITING
HIS
LIP,
THEN:
'I
DIDN'T
WANT
ANY
HARM
TO
HAPPEN
TO
THESE
WHITES
HERE,
BUT
OF
COURSE
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
MR.
KURTZ'S
REPUTATION
--
BUT
YOU
ARE
A
BROTHER
SEAMAN
AND
--'
'ALL
RIGHT,'
SAID
I,
AFTER
A
TIME.
'MR.
KURTZ'S
REPUTATION
IS
SAFE
WITH
ME.'
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
HOW
TRULY
I
SPOKE.


"HE
INFORMED
ME,
LOWERING
HIS
VOICE,
THAT
IT
WAS
KURTZ
WHO
HAD
ORDERED
THE
ATTACK
TO
BE
MADE
ON
THE
STEAMER.
'HE
HATED
SOMETIMES
THE
IDEA
OF
BEING
TAKEN
AWAY
--
AND
THEN
AGAIN....
BUT
I
DON'T
UNDERSTAND
THESE
MATTERS.
I
AM
A
SIMPLE
MAN.
HE
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
SCARE
YOU
AWAY
--
THAT
YOU
WOULD
GIVE
IT
UP,
THINKING
HIM
DEAD.
I
COULD
NOT
STOP
HIM.
OH,
I
HAD
AN
AWFUL
TIME
OF
IT
THIS
LAST
MONTH.'
'VERY
WELL,'
I
SAID.
'HE
IS
ALL
RIGHT
NOW.'
'YE-E-ES,'
HE
MUTTERED,
NOT
VERY
CONVINCED
APPARENTLY.
'THANKS,'
SAID
I;
'I
SHALL
KEEP
MY
EYES
OPEN.'
'BUT
QUIET
--
EH?'
HE
URGED
ANXIOUSLY.
'IT
WOULD
BE
AWFUL
FOR
HIS
REPUTATION
IF
ANYBODY
HERE
--'
I
PROMISED
A
COMPLETE
DISCRETION
WITH
GREAT
GRAVITY.
'I
HAVE
A
CANOE
AND
THREE
BLACK
FELLOWS
WAIT-
ING
NOT
VERY
FAR.
I
AM
OFF.
COULD
YOU
GIVE
ME
A
FEW
MARTINI-HENRY
CARTRIDGES?'
I
COULD,
AND
DID,
WITH
PROPER
SECRECY.
HE
HELPED
HIMSELF,
WITH
A
WINK
AT
ME,
TO
A
HANDFUL
OF
MY
TOBACCO.
'BETWEEN
SAILORS
--
YOU
KNOW
--
GOOD
ENGLISH
TOBACCO.'
AT
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
PILOT-HOUSE
HE
TURNED
ROUND
--
'I
SAY,
HAVEN'T
YOU
A
PAIR
OF
SHOES
YOU
COULD
SPARE?'
HE
RAISED
ONE
LEG.
'LOOK'
THE
SOLES
WERE
TIED
WITH
KNOTTED
STRINGS
SAN-
DALWISE
UNDER
HIS
BARE
FEET.
I
ROOTED
OUT
AN
OLD
PAIR,
AT
WHICH
HE
LOOKED
WITH
ADMIRATION
BEFORE
TUCKING
IT
UNDER
HIS
LEFT
ARM.
ONE
OF
HIS
POCKETS
(BRIGHT
RED)
WAS
BULGING
WITH
CARTRIDGES,
FROM
THE
OTHER
(DARK
BLUE)
PEEPED
'TOWSON'S
INQUIRY,'
CTC.,
ETC.
HE
SEEMED
TO
THINK
HIMSELF
EXCELLENTLY
WELL
EQUIPPED
FOR
A
RE-
NEWED
ENCOUNTER
WITH
THE
WILDERNESS.
'AH!
I'LL
NEVER,
NEVER
MEET
SUCH
A
MAN
AGAIN.
YOU
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
HEARD
HIM
RECITE
POETRY
--
HIS
OWN,
TOO,
IT
WAS,
HE
TOLD
ME.
POETRY!'
HE
ROLLED
HIS
EYES
AT
THE
RECOLLECTION
OF
THESE
DELIGHTS.
'OH,
HE
ENLARGED
MY
MIND!'
'GOOD-
BYE,'
SAID
I.
HE
SHOOK
HANDS
AND
VANISHED
IN
THE
NIGHT.
SOMETIMES
I
ASK
MYSELF
WHETHER
I
HAD
EVER
REALLY
SEEN
HIM
--
WHETHER
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
MEET
SUCH
A
PHENOMENON!
.
.
.


"WHEN
I
WOKE
UP
SHORTLY
AFTER
MIDNIGHT
HIS
WARN-
ING
CAME
TO
MY
MIND
WITH
ITS
HINT
OF
DANGER
THAT
SEEMED,
IN
THE
STARRED
DARKNESS,
REAL
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
ME
GET
UP
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
HAVING
A
LOOK
ROUND.
ON
THE
HILL
A
BIG
FIRE
BURNED,
ILLUMINATING
FITFULLY
A
CROOKED
CORNER
OF
THE
STATION-HOUSE.
ONE
OF
THE
AGENTS
WITH
A
PICKET
OF
A
FEW
OF
OUR
BLACKS,
ARMED
FOR
THE
PURPOSE,
WAS
KEEPING
GUARD
OVER
THE
IVORY;
BUT
DEEP
WITHIN
THE
FOREST,
RED
GLEAMS
THAT
WAVERED,
THAT
SEEMED
TO
SINK
AND
RISE
FROM
THE
GROUND
AMONGST
CONFUSED
COLUMNAR
SHAPES
OF
INTENSE
BLACKNESS,
SHOWED
THE
EXACT
POSITION
OF
THE
CAMP
WHERE
MR.
KURTZ'S
ADORERS
WERE
KEEPING
THEIR
UNEASY
VIGIL.
THE
MONOTO-
NOUS
BEATING
OF
A
BIG
DRUM
FILLED
THE
AIR
WITH
MUF-
FLED
SHOCKS
AND
A
LINGERING
VIBRATION.
A
STEADY
DRONING
SOUND
OF
MANY
MEN
CHANTING
EACH
TO
HIMSELF
SOME
WEIRD
INCANTATION
CAME
OUT
FROM
THE
BLACK,
FLAT
WALL
OF
THE
WOODS
AS
THE
HUMMING
OF
BEES
COMES
OUT
OF
A
HIVE,
AND
HAD
A
STRANGE
NARCOTIC
EFFECT
UPON
MY
HALF-AWAKE
SENSES.
I
BELIEVE
I
DOZED
OFF
LEANING
OVER
THE
RAIL,
TILL
AN
ABRUPT
BURST
OF
YELLS,
AN
OVERWHELMING
OUTBREAK
OF
A
PENT-UP
AND
MYSTERIOUS
FRENZY,
WOKE
ME
UP
IN
A
BEWILDERED
WONDER.
IT
WAS
CUT
SHORT
ALL
AT
ONCE,
AND
THE
LOW
DRONING
WENT
ON
WITH
AN
EFFECT
OF
AUDIBLE
AND
SOOTHING
SILENCE.
I
GLANCED
CASUALLY
INTO
THE
LITTLE
CABIN.
A
LIGHT
WAS
BURNING
WITHIN,
BUT
MR.
KURTZ
WAS
NOT
THERE.


"I
THINK
I
WOULD
HAVE
RAISED
AN
OUTCRY
IF
I
HAD
BELIEVED
MY
EYES.
BUT
I
DIDN'T
BELIEVE
THEM
AT
FIRST
--
THE
THING
SEEMED
SO
IMPOSSIBLE.
THE
FACT
IS
I
WAS
COM-
PLETELY
UNNERVED
BY
A
SHEER
BLANK
FRIGHT,
PURE
ABSTRACT
TERROR,
UNCONNECTED
WITH
ANY
DISTINCT
SHAPE
OF
PHYSICAL
DANGER.
WHAT
MADE
THIS
EMOTION
SO
OVERPOWERING
WAS
--
HOW
SHALL
I
DEFINE
IT?
--
THE
MORAL
SHOCK
I
RE-
CEIVED,
AS
IF
SOMETHING
ALTOGETHER
MONSTROUS,
INTOLER-
ABLE
TO
THOUGHT
AND
ODIOUS
TO
THE
SOUL,
HAD
BEEN
THRUST
UPON
ME
UNEXPECTEDLY.
THIS
LASTED
OF
COURSE
THE
MEREST
FRACTION
OF
A
SECOND,
AND
THEN
THE
USUAL
SENSE
OF
COMMONPLACE,
DEADLY
DANGER,
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
SUDDEN
ONSLAUGHT
AND
MASSACRE,
OR
SOMETHING
OF
THE
KIND,
WHICH
I
SAW
IMPENDING,
WAS
POSITIVELY
WEL-
COME
AND
COMPOSING.
IT
PACIFIED
ME,
IN
FACT,
SO
MUCH
THAT
I
DID
NOT
RAISE
AN
ALARM.


"THERE
WAS
AN
AGENT
BUTTONED
UP
INSIDE
AN
ULSTER
AND
SLEEPING
ON
A
CHAIR
ON
DECK
WITHIN
THREE
FEET
OF
ME.
THE
YELLS
HAD
NOT
AWAKENED
HIM;
HE
SNORED
VERY
SLIGHTLY;
I
LEFT
HIM
TO
HIS
SLUMBERS
AND
LEAPED
ASHORE.
I
DID
NOT
BETRAY
MR.
KURTZ
--
IT
WAS
ORDERED
I
SHOULD
NEVER
BETRAY
HIM
--
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
I
SHOULD
BE
LOYAL
TO
THE
NIGHTMARE
OF
MY
CHOICE.
I
WAS
ANXIOUS
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
SHADOW
BY
MYSELF
ALONE
--
AND
TO
THIS
DAY
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHY
I
WAS
SO
JEALOUS
OF
SHARING
WITH
ANY
ONE
THE
PECULIAR
BLACKNESS
OF
THAT
EXPERIENCE.


"AS
SOON
AS
I
GOT
ON
THE
BANK
I
SAW
A
TRAIL
--
A
BROAD
TRAIL
THROUGH
THE
GRASS.
I
REMEMBER
THE
EXULTATION
WITH
WHICH
I
SAID
TO
MYSELF,
'HE
CAN'T
WALK
--
HE
IS
CRAWLING
ON
ALL-FOURS
--
I'VE
GOT
HIM.'
THE
GRASS
WAS
WET
WITH
DEW.
I
STRODE
RAPIDLY
WITH
CLENCHED
FISTS.
I
FANCY
I
HAD
SOME
VAGUE
NOTION
OF
FALLING
UPON
HIM
AND
GIVING
HIM
A
DRUBBING.
I
DON'T
KNOW.
I
HAD
SOME
IMBECILE
THOUGHTS.
THE
KNITTING
OLD
WOMAN
WITH
THE
CAT
OBTRUDED
HERSELF
UPON
MY
MEMORY
AS
A
MOST
IM-
PROPER
PERSON
TO
BE
SITTING
AT
THE
OTHER
END
OF
SUCH
AN
AFFAIR.
I
SAW
A
ROW
OF
PILGRIMS
SQUIRTING
LEAD
IN
THE
AIR
OUT
OF
WINCHESTERS
HELD
TO
THE
HIP.
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
NEVER
GET
BACK
TO
THE
STEAMER,
AND
IMAGINED
MYSELF
LIVING
ALONE
AND
UNARMED
IN
THE
WOODS
TO
AN
ADVANCED
AGE.
SUCH
SILLY
THINGS
--
YOU
KNOW.
AND
I
REMEMBER
I
CONFOUNDED
THE
BEAT
OF
THE
DRUM
WITH
THE
BEATING
OF
MY
HEART,
AND
WAS
PLEASED
AT
ITS
CALM
REGULARITY.


"I
KEPT
TO
THE
TRACK
THOUGH
--
THEN
STOPPED
TO
LISTEN.
THE
NIGHT
WAS
VERY
CLEAR;
A
DARK
BLUE
SPACE,
SPARKLING
WITH
DEW
AND
STARLIGHT,
IN
WHICH
BLACK
THINGS
STOOD
VERY
STILL.
I
THOUGHT
I
COULD
SEE
A
KIND
OF
MOTION
AHEAD
OF
ME.
I
WAS
STRANGELY
COCKSURE
OF
EVERYTHING
THAT
NIGHT.
I
ACTUALLY
LEFT
THE
TRACK
AND
RAN
IN
A
WIDE
SEMICIRCLE
(I
VERILY
BELIEVE
CHUCKLING
TO
MYSELF)
SO
AS
TO
GET
IN
FRONT
OF
THAT
STIR,
OF
THAT
MOTION
I
HAD
SEEN
--
IF
INDEED
I
HAD
SEEN
ANYTHING.
I
WAS
CIRCUMVENTING
KURTZ
AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD
BEEN
A
BOYISH
GAME.


"I
CAME
UPON
HIM,
AND,
IF
HE
HAD
NOT
HEARD
ME
COMING,
I
WOULD
HAVE
FALLEN
OVER
HIM,
TOO,
BUT
HE
GOT
UP
IN
TIME.
HE
ROSE,
UNSTEADY,
LONG,
PALE,
INDISTINCT,
LIKE
A
VAPOUR
EXHALED
BY
THE
EARTH,
AND
SWAYED
SLIGHTLY,
MISTY
AND
SILENT
BEFORE
ME;
WHILE
AT
MY
BACK
THE
FIRES
LOOMED
BETWEEN
THE
TREES,
AND
THE
MURMUR
OF
MANY
VOICES
ISSUED
FROM
THE
FOREST.
I
HAD
CUT
HIM
OFF
CLEVERLY;
BUT
WHEN
ACTUALLY
CONFRONTING
HIM
I
SEEMED
TO
COME
TO
MY
SENSES,
I
SAW
THE
DANGER
IN
ITS
RIGHT
PROPORTION.
IT
WAS
BY
NO
MEANS
OVER
YET.
SUP-
POSE
HE
BEGAN
TO
SHOUT?
THOUGH
HE
COULD
HARDLY
STAND,
THERE
WAS
STILL
PLENTY
OF
VIGOUR
IN
HIS
VOICE.
'GO
AWAY
--
HIDE
YOURSELF,'
HE
SAID,
IN
THAT
PROFOUND
TONE.
IT
WAS
VERY
AWFUL.
I
GLANCED
BACK.
WE
WERE
WITHIN
THIRTY
YARDS
FROM
THE
NEAREST
FIRE.
A
BLACK
FIGURE
STOOD
UP,
STRODE
ON
LONG
BLACK
LEGS,
WAVING
LONG
BLACK
ARMS,
ACROSS
THE
GLOW.
IT
HAD
HORNS
--
ANTELOPE
HORNS,
I
THINK
--
ON
ITS
HEAD.
SOME
SORCERER,
SOME
WITCH-MAN,
NO
DOUBT:
IT
LOOKED
FIENDLIKE
ENOUGH.
'DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING?'
I
WHISPERED.
'PERFECTLY,'
HE
ANSWERED,
RAISING
HIS
VOICE
FOR
THAT
SINGLE
WORD:
IT
SOUNDED
TO
ME
FAR
OFF
AND
YET
LOUD,
LIKE
A
HAIL
THROUGH
A
SPEAKING-
TRUMPET.
'IF
HE
MAKES
A
ROW
WE
ARE
LOST,'
I
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF.
THIS
CLEARLY
WAS
NOT
A
CASE
FOR
FISTICUFFS,
EVEN
APART
FROM
THE
VERY
NATURAL
AVERSION
I
HAD
TO
BEAT
THAT
SHADOW
--
THIS
WANDERING
AND
TORMENTED
THING.
'YOU
WILL
BE
LOST,'
I
SAID
--
'UTTERLY
LOST.'
ONE
GETS
SOMETIMES
SUCH
A
FLASH
OF
INSPIRATION,
YOU
KNOW.
I
DID
SAY
THE
RIGHT
THING,
THOUGH
INDEED
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
IRRETRIEVABLY
LOST
THAN
HE
WAS
AT
THIS
VERY
MOMENT,
WHEN
THE
FOUNDATIONS
OF
OUR
INTIMACY
WERE
BEING
LAID
--
TO
ENDURE
--
TO
ENDURE
--
EVEN
TO
THE
END
--
EVEN
BEYOND.


"
'I
HAD
IRNMENSE
PLANS,'
HE
MUTTERED
IRRESOLUTELY.
'YES,'
SAID
I;
'BUT
IF
YOU
TRY
TO
SHOUT
I'LL
SMASH
YOUR
HEAD
WITH
--'
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
STICK
OR
A
STONE
NEAR.
'I
WILL
THROTTLE
YOU
FOR
GOOD,'
I
CORRECTED
MYSELF.
'I
WAS
ON
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
GREAT
THINGS,'
HE
PLEADED,
IN
A
VOICE
OF
LONGING,
WITH
A
WISTFULNESS
OF
TONE
THAT
MADE
MY
BLOOD
RUN
COLD.
'AND
NOW
FOR
THIS
STUPID
SCOUN-
DREL
--'
'YOUR
SUCCESS
IN
EUROPE
IS
ASSURED
IN
ANY
CASE,'
I
AFFIRMED
STEADILY,
I
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
HAVE
THE
THROTTLING
OF
HIM,
YOU
UNDERSTAND
--
AND
INDEED
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
LITTLE
USE
FOR
ANY
PRACTICAL
PUR-
POSE.
I
TRIED
TO
BREAK
THE
SPELL
--
THE
HEAVY,
MUTE
SPELL
OF
THE
WILDERNESS
--
THAT
SEEMED
TO
DRAW
HIM
TO
ITS
PITILESS
BREAST
BY
THE
AWAKENING
OF
FORGOTTEN
AND
BRUTAL
INSTINCTS,
BY
THE
MEMORY
OF
GRATIFIED
AND
MON-
STROUS
PASSIONS.
THIS
ALONE,
I
WAS
CONVINCED,
HAD
DRIVEN
HIM
OUT
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
FOREST,
TO
THE
BUSH,
TOWARDS
THE
GLEAM
OF
FIRES,
THE
THROB
OF
DRUMS,
THE
DRONE
OF
WEIRD
INCANTATIONS;
THIS
ALONE
HAD
BEGUILED
HIS
UNLAWFUL
SOUL
BEYOND
THE
BOUNDS
OF
PERMITTED
ASPIRATIONS.
AND,
DON'T
YOU
SEE,
THE
TERROR
OF
THE
POSI-
TION
WAS
NOT
IN
BEING
KNOCKED
ON
THE
HEAD
--
THOUGH
I
HAD
A
VERY
LIVELY
SENSE
OF
THAT
DANGER,
TOO
--
BUT
IN
THIS,
THAT
I
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
A
BEING
TO
WHOM
I
COULD
NOT
APPEAL
IN
THE
NAME
OF
ANYTHING
HIGH
OR
LOW.
I
HAD,
EVEN
LIKE
THE
NIGGERS,
TO
INVOKE
HIM
--
HIMSELF
--
HIS
OWN
EXALTED
AND
INCREDIBLE
DEGRADATION.
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
EITHER
ABOVE
OR
BELOW
HIM,
AND
I
KNEW
IT.
HE
HAD
KICKED
HIMSELF
LOOSE
OF
THE
EARTH.
CONFOUND
THE
MAN!
HE
HAD
KICKED
THE
VERY
EARTH
TO
PIECES.
HE
WAS
ALONE,
AND
I
BEFORE
HIM
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
I
STOOD
ON
THE
GROUND
OR
FLOATED
IN
THE
AIR.
I'VE
BEEN
TELLING
YOU
WHAT
WE
SAID
--
REPEATING
THE
PHRASES
WE
PRO-
NOUNCED
--
BUT
WHAT'S
THE
GOOD?
THEY
WERE
COMMON
EVERYDAY
WORDS
--
THE
FAMILIAR,
VAGUE
SOUNDS
EX-
CHANGED
ON
EVERY
WAKING
DAY
OF
LIFE.
BUT
WHAT
OF
THAT?
THEY
HAD
BEHIND
THEM,
TO
MY
MIND,
THE
TERRIFIC
SUGGESTIVENESS
OF
WORDS
HEARD
IN
DREAMS,
OF
PHRASES
SPOKEN
IN
NIGHTMARES.
SOUL!
IF
ANYBODY
EVER
STRUGGLED
WITH
A
SOUL,
I
AM
THE
MAN.
AND
I
WASN'T
ARGUING
WITH
A
LUNATIC
EITHER.
BELIEVE
ME
OR
NOT,
HIS
INTELLIGENCE
WAS
PERFECTLY
CLEAR
CONCENTRATED,
IT
IS
TRUE,
UPON
HIMSELF
WITH
HORRIBLE
INTENSITY,
YET
CLEAR;
AND
THEREIN
WAS
MY
ONLY
CHANCE
--
BARRING,
OF
COURSE,
THE
KILLING
HIM
THERE
AND
THEN,
WHICH
WASN'T
SO
GOOD,
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
UN-
AVOIDABLE
NOISE.
BUT
HIS
SOUL
WAS
MAD.
BEING
ALONE
IN
THE
WILDERNESS,
IT
HAD
LOOKED
WITHIN
ITSELF,
AND,
BY
HEAVENS!
I
TELL
YOU,
IT
HAD
GONE
MAD.
I
HAD
--
FOR
MY
SINS,
I
SUPPOSE
--
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
ORDEAL
OF
LOOKING
INTO
IT
MYSELF.
NO
ELOQUENCE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SO
WITHERING
TO
ONE'S
BELIEF
IN
MANKIND
AS
HIS
FINAL
BURST
OF
SINCERITY.
HE
STRUGGLED
WITH
HIMSELF,
TOO.
I
SAW
IT
--
I
HEARD
IT.
I
SAW
THE
INCONCEIVABLE
MYSTERY
OF
A
SOUL
THAT
KNEW
NO
RESTRAINT,
NO
FAITH,
AND
NO
FEAR,
YET
STRUG-
GLING
BLINDLY
WITH
ITSELF.
I
KEPT
MY
HEAD
PRETTY
WELL;
BUT
WHEN
I
HAD
HIM
AT
LAST
STRETCHED
ON
THE
COUCH,
I
WIPED
MY
FOREHEAD,
WHILE
MY
LEGS
SHOOK
UNDER
ME
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
CARRIED
HALF
A
TON
ON
MY
BACK
DOWN
THAT
HILL.
AND
YET
I
HAD
ONLY
SUPPORTED
HIM,
HIS
BONY
ARM
CLASPED
ROUND
MY
NECK
--
AND
HE
WAS
NOT
MUCH
HEAVIER
THAN
A
CHILD.


"WHEN
NEXT
DAY
WE
LEFT
AT
NOON,
THE
CROWD,
OF
WHOSE
PRESENCE
BEHIND
THE
CURTAIN
OF
TREES
I
HAD
BEEN
ACUTELY
CONSCIOUS
ALL
THE
TIME,
FLOWED
OUT
OF
THE
WOODS
AGAIN,
FILLED
THE
CLEARING,
COVERED
THE
SLOPE
WITH
A
MASS
OF
NAKED,
BREATHING,
QUIVERING,
BRONZE
BODIES.
I
STEAMED
UP
A
BIT,
THEN
SWUNG
DOWN
STREAM,
AND
TWO
THOUSAND
EYES
FOLLOWED
THE
EVOLUTIONS
OF
THE
SPLASH-
ING,
THUMPING,
FIERCE
RIVER-DEMON
BEATING
THE
WATER
WITH
ITS
TERRIBLE
TAIL
AND
BREATHING
BLACK
SMOKE
INTO
THE
AIR.
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
FIRST
RANK,
ALONG
THE
RIVER,
THREE
MEN,
PLASTERED
WITH
BRIGHT
RED
EARTH
FROM
HEAD
TO
FOOT,
STRUTTED
TO
AND
FRO
RESTLESSLY.
WHEN
WE
CAME
ABREAST
AGAIN,
THEY
FACED
THE
RIVER,
STAMPED
THEIR
FEET,
NODDED
THEIR
HORNED
HEADS,
SWAYED
THEIR
SCARLET
BOD-
IES;
THEY
SHOOK
TOWARDS
THE
FIERCE
RIVER-DEMON
A
BUNCH
OF
BLACK
FEATHERS,
A
MANGY
SKIN
WITH
A
PENDENT
TAIL
--
SOMETHING
THAT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
DRIED
GOURD;
THEY
SHOUTED
PERIODICALLY
TOGETHER
STRINGS
OF
AMAZING
WORDS
THAT
RESEMBLED
NO
SOUNDS
OF
HUMAN
LANGUAGE;
AND
THE
DEEP
MURMURS
OF
THE
CROWD,
INTERRUPTED
SUD-
DENLY,
WERE
LIKE
THE
RESPONSES
OF
SOME
SATANIC
LITANY.


"WE
HAD
CARRIED
KURTZ
INTO
THE
PILOT-HOUSE:
THERE
WAS
MORE
AIR
THERE.
LYING
ON
THE
COUCH,
HE
STARED
THROUGH
THE
OPEN
SHUTTER.
THERE
WAS
AN
EDDY
IN
THE
MASS
OF
HUMAN
BODIES,
AND
THE
WOMAN
WITH
HELMETED
HEAD
AND
TAWNY
CHEEKS
RUSHED
OUT
TO
THE
VERY
BRINK
OF
THE
STREAM.
SHE
PUT
OUT
HER
HANDS,
SHOUTED
SOME-
THING,
AND
ALL
THAT
WILD
MOB
TOOK
UP
THE
SHOUT
IN
A
ROARING
CHORUS
OF
ARTICULATED,
RAPID,
BREATHLESS
UT-
TERANCE.


"
'DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THIS?'
I
ASKED.


"HE
KEPT
ON
LOOKING
OUT
PAST
ME
WITH
FIERY,
LONG-
ING
EYES,
WITH
A
MINGLED
EXPRESSION
OF
WISTFULNESS
AND
HATE.
HE
MADE
NO
ANSWER,
BUT
I
SAW
A
SMILE,
A
SMILE
OF
INDEFINABLE
MEANING,
APPEARING
ON
HIS
COLOURLESS
LIPS
THAT
A
MOMENT
AFTER
TWITCHED
CONVULSIVELY.
'DO
I
NOT?'
HE
SAID
SLOWLY,
GASPING,
AS
IF
THE
WORDS
HAD
BEEN
TORN
OUT
OF
HIM
BY
A
SUPERNATURAL
POWER.


"I
PULLED
THE
STRING
OF
THE
WHISTLE,
AND
I
DID
THIS
BECAUSE
I
SAW
THE
PILGRIMS
ON
DECK
GETTING
OUT
THEIR
RIFLES
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
ANTICIPATING
A
JOLLY
LARK.
AT
THE
SUDDEN
SCREECH
THERE
WAS
A
MOVEMENT
OF
ABJECT
TERROR
THROUGH
THAT
WEDGED
MASS
OF
BODIES.
'DON'T!
DON'T
YOU
FRIGHTEN
THEM
AWAY,'
CRIED
SOME
ONE
ON
DECK
DISCON-
SOLATELY.
I
PULLED
THE
STRING
TIME
AFTER
TIME.
THEY
BROKE
AND
RAN,
THEY
LEAPED,
THEY
CROUCHED,
THEY
SWERVED,
THEY
DODGED
THE
FLYING
TERROR
OF
THE
SOUND.
THE
THREE
RED
CHAPS
HAD
FALLEN
FLAT,
FACE
DOWN
ON
THE
SHORE,
AS
THOUGH
THEY
HAD
BEEN
SHOT
DEAD.
ONLY
THE
BARBAROUS
AND
SUPERB
WOMAN
DID
NOT
SO
MUCH
AS
FLINCH,
AND
STRETCHED
TRAGICALLY
HER
BARE
ARMS
AFTER
US
OVER
THE
SOMBRE
AND
GLITTERING
RIVER.


"AND
THEN
THAT
IMBECILE
CROWD
DOWN
ON
THE
DECK
STARTED
THEIR
LITTLE
FUN,
AND
I
COULD
SEE
NOTHING
MORE
FOR
SMOKE.




"THE
BROWN
CURRENT
RAN
SWIFTLY
OUT
OF
THE
HEART
OF
DARKNESS,
BEARING
US
DOWN
TOWARDS
THE
SEA
WITH
TWICE
THE
SPEED
OF
OUR
UPWARD
PROGRESS;
AND
KURTZ'S
LIFE
WAS
RUNNING
SWIFTLY,
TOO,
EBBING,
EBBING
OUT
OF
HIS
HEART
INTO
THE
SEA
OF
INEXORABLE
TIME.
THE
MANAGER
WAS
VERY
PLACID,
HE
HAD
NO
VITAL
ANXIETIES
NOW,
HE
TOOK
US
BOTH
IN
WITH
A
COMPREHENSIVE
AND
SATISFIED
GLANCE:
THE
'AFFAIR'
HAD
COME
OFF
AS
WELL
AS
COULD
BE
WISHED.
I
SAW
THE
TIME
APPROACHING
WHEN
I
WOULD
BE
LEFT
ALONE
OF
THE
PARTY
OF
'UNSOUND
METHOD.'
THE
PILGRIMS
LOOKED
UPON
ME
WITH
DISFAVOUR.
I
WAS,
SO
TO
SPEAK,
NUMBERED
WITH
THE
DEAD.
IT
IS
STRANGE
HOW
I
ACCEPTED
THIS
UNFORESEEN
PARTNERSHIP,
THIS
CHOICE
OF
NIGHTMARES
FORCED
UPON
ME
IN
THE
TENEBROUS
LAND
INVADED
BY
THESE
MEAN
AND
GREEDY
PHANTOMS.


"KURTZ
DISCOURSED.
A
VOICE!
A
VOICE!
IT
RANG
DEEP
TO
THE
VERY
LAST.
IT
SURVIVED
HIS
STRENGTH
TO
HIDE
IN
THE
MAGNIFICENT
FOLDS
OF
ELOQUENCE
THE
BARREN
DARKNESS
OF
HIS
HEART.
OH,
HE
STRUGGLED!
HE
STRUGGLED!
THE
WASTES
OF
HIS
WEARY
BRAIN
WERE
HAUNTED
BY
SHADOWY
IMAGES
NOW
--
IMAGES
OF
WEALTH
AND
FAME
REVOLVING
OBSE-
QUIOUSLY
ROUND
HIS
UNEXTINGUISHABLE
GIFT
OF
NOBLE
AND
LOFTY
EXPRESSION.
MY
INTENDED,
MY
STATION,
MY
CAREER,
MY
IDEAS
--
THESE
WERE
THE
SUBJECTS
FOR
THE
OCCASIONAL
UTTERANCES
OF
ELEVATED
SENTIMENTS.
THE
SHADE
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
KURTZ
FREQUENTED
THE
BEDSIDE
OF
THE
HOLLOW
SHAM,
WHOSE
FATE
IT
WAS
TO
BE
BURIED
PRESENTLY
IN
THE
MOULD
OF
PRIMEVAL
EARTH.
BUT
BOTH
THE
DIABOLIC
LOVE
AND
THE
UNEARTHLY
HATE
OF
THE
MYSTERIES
IT
HAD
PENE-
TRATED
FOUGHT
FOR
THE
POSSESSION
OF
THAT
SOUL
SATIATED
WITH
PRIMITIVE
EMOTIONS,
AVID
OF
LYING
FAME,
OF
SHAM
DISTINCTION,
OF
ALL
THE
APPEARANCES
OF
SUCCESS
AND
POWER.


"SOMETIMES
HE
WAS
CONTEMPTIBLY
CHILDISH.
HE
DE-
SIRED
TO
HAVE
KINGS
MEET
HIM
AT
RAILWAY-STATIONS
ON
HIS
RETURN
FROM
SOME
GHASTLY
NOWHERE,
WHERE
HE
IN-
TENDED
TO
ACCOMPLISH
GREAT
THINGS.
'YOU
SHOW
THEM
YOU
HAVE
IN
YOU
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
REALLY
PROFITABLE,
AND
THEN
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
LIMITS
TO
THE
RECOGNITION
OF
YOUR
ABILITY,'
HE
WOULD
SAY.
'OF
COURSE
YOU
MUST
TAKE
CARE
OF
THE
MOTIVES
--
RIGHT
MOTIVES
--
ALWAYS.'
THE
LONG
REACHES
THAT
WERE
LIKE
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
REACH,
MONOTONOUS
BENDS
THAT
WERE
EXACTLY
ALIKE,
SLIPPED
PAST
THE
STEAMER
WITH
THEIR
MULTITUDE
OF
SECULAR
TREES
LOOKING
PATIENTLY
AFTER
THIS
GRIMY
FRAGMENT
OF
AN-
OTHER
WORLD,
THE
FORERUNNER
OF
CHANGE,
OF
CONQUEST,
OF
TRADE,
OF
MASSACRES,
OF
BLESSINGS.
I
LOOKED
AHEAD
--
PILOTING.
'CLOSE
THE
SHUTTER,'
SAID
KURTZ
SUDDENLY
ONE
DAY;
'I
CAN'T
BEAR
TO
LOOK
AT
THIS.'
I
DID
SO.
THERE
WAS
A
SILENCE.
'OH,
BUT
I
WILL
WRING
YOUR
HEART
YET!'
HE
CRIED
AT
THE
INVISIBLE
WILDERNESS.


"WE
BROKE
DOWN
--
AS
I
HAD
EXPECTED
--
AND
HAD
TO
LIE
UP
FOR
REPAIRS
AT
THE
HEAD
OF
AN
ISLAND.
THIS
DELAY
WAS
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
SHOOK
KURTZ'S
CONFIDENCE.
ONE
MORNING
HE
GAVE
ME
A
PACKET
OF
PAPERS
AND
A
PHOTO-
GRAPH
--
THE
LOT
TIED
TOGETHER
WITH
A
SHOE-STRING.
'KEEP
THIS
FOR
ME,'
HE
SAID.
'THIS
NOXIOUS
FOOL'
(MEANING
THE
MANAGER)
'IS
CAPABLE
OF
PRYING
INTO
MY
BOXES
WHEN
I
AM
NOT
LOOKING.'
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
I
SAW
HIM.
HE
WAS
LYING
ON
HIS
BACK
WITH
CLOSED
EYES,
AND
I
WITHDREW
QUIETLY,
BUT
I
HEARD
HIM
MUTTER,
'LIVE
RIGHTLY,
DIE,
DIE
.
.
.'
I
LISTENED.
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
MORE.
WAS
HE
REHEARSING
SOME
SPEECH
IN
HIS
SLEEP,
OR
WAS
IT
A
FRAG-
MENT
OF
A
PHRASE
FROM
SOME
NEWSPAPER
ARTICLE?
HE
HAD
BEEN
WRITING
FOR
THE
PAPERS
AND
MEANT
TO
DO
SO
AGAIN,
'FOR
THE
FURTHERING
OF
MY
IDEAS.
IT'S
A
DUTY.'


"HIS
WAS
AN
IMPENETRABLE
DARKNESS.
I
LOOKED
AT
HIM
AS
YOU
PEER
DOWN
AT
A
MAN
WHO
IS
LYING
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
A
PRECIPICE
WHERE
THE
SUN
NEVER
SHINES.
BUT
I
HAD
NOT
MUCH
TIME
TO
GIVE
HIM,
BECAUSE
I
WAS
HELPING
THE
ENGINE-DRIVER
TO
TAKE
TO
PIECES
THE
LEAKY
CYLINDERS,
TO
STRAIGHTEN
A
BENT
CONNECTING-ROD,
AND
IN
OTHER
SUCH
MATTERS.
I
LIVED
IN
AN
INFERNAL
MESS
OF
RUST,
FILINGS,
NUTS,
BOLTS,
SPANNERS,
HAMMERS,
RATCHET
DRILLS
--
THINGS
I
ABOMINATE,
BECAUSE
I
DON'T
GET
ON
WITH
THEM.
I
TENDED
THE
LITTLE
FORGE
WE
FORTUNATELY
HAD
ABOARD;
I
TOILED
WEARILY
IN
A
WRETCHED
SCRAP-HEAP
--
UNLESS
I
HAD
THE
SHAKES
TOO
BAD
TO
STAND.


"ONE
EVENING
COMING
IN
WITH
A
CANDLE
I
WAS
STAR-
TLED
TO
HEAR
HIM
SAY
A
LITTLE
TREMULOUSLY,
'I
AM
LYING
HERE
IN
THE
DARK
WAITING
FOR
DEATH.'
THE
LIGHT
WAS
WITHIN
A
FOOT
OF
HIS
EYES.
I
FORCED
MYSELF
TO
MURMUR,
'OH,
NONSENSE!'
AND
STOOD
OVER
HIM
AS
IF
TRANSFIXED.


"ANYTHING
APPROACHING
THE
CHANGE
THAT
CAME
OVER
HIS
FEATURES
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
BEFORE,
AND
HOPE
NEVER
TO
SEE
AGAIN.
OH,
I
WASN'T
TOUCHED.
I
WAS
FASCINATED.
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
A
VEIL
HAD
BEEN
RENT.
I
SAW
ON
THAT
IVORY
FACE
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
SOMBRE
PRIDE,
OF
RUTHLESS
POWER,
OF
CRAVEN
TERROR
--
OF
AN
INTENSE
AND
HOPELESS
DESPAIR.
DID
HE
LIVE
HIS
LIFE
AGAIN
IN
EVERY
DETAIL
OF
DESIRE,
TEMPTATION,
AND
SURRENDER
DURING
THAT
SU-
PREME
MOMENT
OF
COMPLETE
KNOWLEDGE?
HE
CRIED
IN
A
WHISPER
AT
SOME
IMAGE,
AT
SOME
VISION
--
HE
CRIED
OUT
TWICE,
A
CRY
THAT
WAS
NO
MORE
THAN
A
BREATH:


"
'THE
HORROR!
THE
HORROR!'


"I
BLEW
THE
CANDLE
OUT
AND
LEFT
THE
CABIN.
THE
PIL-
GRIMS
WERE
DINING
IN
THE
MESS-ROOM,
AND
I
TOOK
MY
PLACE
OPPOSITE
THE
MANAGER,
WHO
LIFTED
HIS
EYES
TO
GIVE
ME
A
QUESTIONING
GLANCE,
WHICH
I
SUCCESSFULLY
IG-
NORED.
HE
LEANED
BACK,
SERENE,
WITH
THAT
PECULIAR
SMILE
OF
HIS
SEALING
THE
UNEXPRESSED
DEPTHS
OF
HIS
MEANNESS.
A
CONTINUOUS
SHOWER
OF
SMALL
FLIES
STREAMED
UPON
THE
LAMP,
UPON
THE
CLOTH,
UPON
OUR
HANDS
AND
FACES.
SUDDENLY
THE
MANAGER'S
BOY
PUT
HIS
INSOLENT
BLACK
HEAD
IN
THE
DOORWAY,
AND
SAID
IN
A
TONE
OF
SCATH-
ING
CONTEMPT:


"
'MISTAH
KURTZ
--
HE
DEAD.'


"ALL
THE
PILGRIMS
RUSHED
OUT
TO
SEE.
I
REMAINED,
AND
WENT
ON
WITH
MY
DINNER.
I
BELIEVE
THAT
I
WAS
CON-
SIDERED
BRUTALLY
CALLOUS.
HOWEVER,
I
DID
NOT
EAT
MUCH.
THERE
WAS
A
LAMP
IN
THERE
--
LIGHT,
DON'T
YOU
KNOW
--
AND
OUTSIDE
IT
WAS
SO
BEASTLY,
BEASTLY
DARK.
I
WENT
NO
MORE
NEAR
THE
REMARKABLE
MAN
WHO
HAD
PRONOUNCED
A
JUDGMENT
UPON
THE
ADVENTURES
OF
HIS
SOUL
ON
THIS
EARTH.
THE
VOICE
WAS
GONE.
WHAT
ELSE
HAD
BEEN
THERE?
BUT
I
AM
OF
COURSE
AWARE
THAT
NEXT
DAY
THE
PILGRIMS
BURIED
SOMETHING
IN
A
MUDDY
HOLE.


"AND
THEN
THEY
VERY
NEARLY
BURIED
ME.


"HOWEVER,
AS
YOU
SEE,
I
DID
NOT
GO
TO
JOIN
KURTZ
THERE
AND
THEN.
I
DID
NOT.
I
REMAINED
TO
DREAM
THE
NIGHTMARE
OUT
TO
THE
END,
AND
TO
SHOW
MY
LOYALTY
TO
KURTZ
ONCE
MORE.
DESTINY.
MY
DESTINY!
DROLL
THING
LIFE
IS
--
THAT
MYSTERIOUS
ARRANGEMENT
OF
MERCILESS
LOGIC
FOR
A
FUTILE
PURPOSE.
THE
MOST
YOU
CAN
HOPE
FROM
IT
IS
SOME
KNOWLEDGE
OF
YOURSELF
--
THAT
COMES
TOO
LATE
--
A
CROP
OF
UNEXTINGUISHABLE
REGRETS.
I
HAVE
WRESTLED
WITH
DEATH.
IT
IS
THE
MOST
UNEXCITING
CONTEST
YOU
CAN
IMAGINE.
IT
TAKES
PLACE
IN
AN
IMPALPABLE
GREYNESS,
WITH
NOTHING
UNDERFOOT,
WITH
NOTHING
AROUND,
WITHOUT
SPECTATORS,
WITHOUT
CLAMOUR,
WITHOUT
GLORY,
WITHOUT
THE
GREAT
DESIRE
OF
VICTORY,
WITHOUT
THE
GREAT
FEAR
OF
DEFEAT,
IN
A
SICKLY
ATMOSPHERE
OF
TEPID
SCEPTICISM,
WITHOUT
MUCH
BELIEF
IN
YOUR
OWN
RIGHT,
AND
STILL
LESS
IN
THAT
OF
YOUR
ADVERSARY.
IF
SUCH
IS
THE
FORM
OF
ULTI-
MATE
WISDOM,
THEN
LIFE
IS
A
GREATER
RIDDLE
THAN
SOME
OF
US
THINK
IT
TO
BE.
I
WAS
WITHIN
A
HAIR'S
BREADTH
OF
THE
LAST
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT,
AND
I
FOUND
WITH
HUMILIATION
THAT
PROBABLY
I
WOULD
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
SAY.
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
WHY
I
AFFIRM
THAT
KURTZ
WAS
A
REMARKABLE
MAN.
HE
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
SAY.
HE
SAID
IT.
SINCE
I
HAD
PEEPED
OVER
THE
EDGE
MYSELF,
I
UNDER-
STAND
BETTER
THE
MEANING
OF
HIS
STARE,
THAT
COULD
NOT
SEE
THE
FLAME
OF
THE
CANDLE,
BUT
WAS
WIDE
ENOUGH
TO
EMBRACE
THE
WHOLE
UNIVERSE,
PIERCING
ENOUGH
TO
PENE-
TRATE
ALL
THE
HEARTS
THAT
BEAT
IN
THE
DARKNESS.
HE
HAD
SUMMED
UP
--
HE
HAD
JUDGED.
'THE
HORROR!'
HE
WAS
A
REMARKABLE
MAN.
AFTER
ALL,
THIS
WAS
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
SOME
SORT
OF
BELIEF;
IT
HAD
CANDOUR,
IT
HAD
CONVICTION,
IT
HAD
A
VIBRATING
NOTE
OF
REVOLT
IN
ITS
WHISPER,
IT
HAD
THE
APPALLING
FACE
OF
A
GLIMPSED
TRUTH
--
THE
STRANGE
COMMINGLING
OF
DESIRE
AND
HATE.
AND
IT
IS
NOT
MY
OWN
EXTREMITY
I
REMEMBER
BEST
--
A
VISION
OF
GREYNESS
WITH-
OUT
FORM
FILLED
WITH
PHYSICAL
PAIN,
AND
A
CARELESS
CON-
TEMPT
FOR
THE
EVANESCENCE
OF
ALL
THINGS
--
EVEN
OF
THIS
PAIN
ITSELF.
NO!
IT
IS
HIS
EXTREMITY
THAT
I
SEEM
TO
HAVE
LIVED
THROUGH.
TRUE,
HE
HAD
MADE
THAT
LAST
STRIDE,
HE
HAD
STEPPED
OVER
THE
EDGE,
WHILE
I
HAD
BEEN
PERMIT-
TED
TO
DRAW
BACK
MY
HESITATING
FOOT.
AND
PERHAPS
IN
THIS
IS
THE
WHOLE
DIFFERENCE;
PERHAPS
ALL
THE
WISDOM,
AND
ALL
TRUTH,
AND
ALL
SINCERITY,
ARE
JUST
COMPRESSED
INTO
THAT
INAPPRECIABLE
MOMENT
OF
TIME
IN
WHICH
WE
STEP
OVER
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
THE
INVISIBLE.
PERHAPS!
I
LIKE
TO
THINK
MY
SUMMING-UP
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
A
WORD
OF
CARELESS
CONTEMPT.
BETTER
HIS
CRY
--
MUCH
BET-
TER.
IT
WAS
AN
AFFIRMATION,
A
MORAL
VICTORY
PAID
FOR
BY
INNUMERABLE
DEFEATS,
BY
ABOMINABLE
TERRORS,
BY
ABOMI-
NABLE
SATISFACTIONS.
BUT
IT
WAS
A
VICTORY!
THAT
IS
WHY
I
HAVE
REMAINED
LOYAL
TO
KURTZ
TO
THE
LAST,
AND
EVEN
BEYOND,
WHEN
A
LONG
TIME
AFTER
I
HEARD
ONCE
MORE,
NOT
HIS
OWN
VOICE,
BUT
THE
ECHO
OF
HIS
MAGNIFICENT
ELO-
QUENCE
THROWN
TO
ME
FROM
A
SOUL
AS
TRANSLUCENTLY
PURE
AS
A
CLIFF
OF
CRYSTAL.


"NO,
THEY
DID
NOT
BURY
ME,
THOUGH
THERE
IS
A
PERIOD
OF
TIME
WHICH
I
REMEMBER
MISTILY,
WITH
A
SHUDDERING
WONDER,
LIKE
A
PASSAGE
THROUGH
SOME
INCONCEIVABLE
WORLD
THAT
HAD
NO
HOPE
IN
IT
AND
NO
DESIRE.
I
FOUND
MYSELF
BACK
IN
THE
SEPULCHRAL
CITY
RESENTING
THE
SIGHT
OF
PEOPLE
HURRYING
THROUGH
THE
STREETS
TO
FILCH
A
LITTLE
MONEY
FROM
EACH
OTHER,
TO
DEVOUR
THEIR
INFAMOUS
COOKERY,
TO
GULP
THEIR
UNWHOLESOME
BEER,
TO
DREAM
THEIR
INSIGNIFICANT
AND
SILLY
DREAMS.
THEY
TRESPASSED
UPON
MY
THOUGHTS.
THEY
WERE
INTRUDERS
WHOSE
KNOWL-
EDGE
OF
LIFE
WAS
TO
ME
AN
IRRITATING
PRETENCE,
BECAUSE
I
FELT
SO
SURE
THEY
COULD
NOT
POSSIBLY
KNOW
THE
THINGS
I
KNEW.
THEIR
BEARING,
WHICH
WAS
SIMPLY
THE
BEARING
OF
COMMONPLACE
INDIVIDUALS
GOING
ABOUT
THEIR
BUSINESS
IN
THE
ASSURANCE
OF
PERFECT
SAFETY,
WAS
OFFENSIVE
TO
ME
LIKE
THE
OUTRAGEOUS
FLAUNTINGS
OF
FOLLY
IN
THE
FACE
OF
A
DANGER
IT
IS
UNABLE
TO
COMPREHEND.
I
HAD
NO
PARTICULAR
DESIRE
TO
ENLIGHTEN
THEM,
BUT
I
HAD
SOME
DIFFICULTY
IN
RESTRAINING
MYSELF
FROM
LAUGHING
IN
THEIR
FACES
SO
FULL
OF
STUPID
IMPORTANCE.
I
DARESAY
I
WAS
NOT
VERY
WELL
AT
THAT
TIME.
I
TOTTERED
ABOUT
THE
STREETS
--
THERE
WERE
VARIOUS
AFFAIRS
TO
SETTLE
--
GRINNING
BITTERLY
AT
PERFECTLY
RESPECTABLE
PERSONS.
I
ADMIT
MY
BEHAVIOUR
WAS
INEX-
CUSABLE,
BUT
THEN
MY
TEMPERATURE
WAS
SELDOM
NORMAL
IN
THESE
DAYS.
MY
DEAR
AUNT'S
ENDEAVOURS
TO
'NURSE
UP
MY
STRENGTH'
SEEMED
ALTOGETHER
BESIDE
THE
MARK.
IT
WAS
NOT
MY
STRENGTH
THAT
WANTED
NURSING,
IT
WAS
MY
IMAGINATION
THAT
WANTED
SOOTHING.
I
KEPT
THE
BUNDLE
OF
PAPERS
GIVEN
ME
BY
KURTZ,
NOT
KNOWING
EXACTLY
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
IT.
HIS
MOTHER
HAD
DIED
LATELY,
WATCHED
OVER,
AS
I
WAS
TOLD,
BY
HIS
INTENDED.
A
CLEAN-
SHAVED
MAN,
WITH
AN
OFFICIAL
MANNER
AND
WEARING
GOLD-RIMMED
SPECTACLES,
CALLED
ON
ME
ONE
DAY
AND
MADE
INQUIRIES,
AT
FIRST
CIRCUITOUS,
AFTERWARDS
SUAVELY
PRESSING,
ABOUT
WHAT
HE
WAS
PLEASED
TO
DENOMINATE
CERTAIN
'DOCUMENTS.'
I
WAS
NOT
SURPRISED,
BECAUSE
I
HAD
HAD
TWO
ROWS
WITH
THE
MANAGER
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OUT
THERE.
I
HAD
REFUSED
TO
GIVE
UP
THE
SMALLEST
SCRAP
OUT
OF
THAT
PACKAGE,
AND
I
TOOK
THE
SAME
ATTITUDE
WITH
THE
SPECTACLED
MAN.
HE
BECAME
DARKLY
MENACING
AT
LAST,
AND
WITH
MUCH
HEAT
ARGUED
THAT
THE
COMPANY
HAD
THE
RIGHT
TO
EVERY
BIT
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
ITS
'TERRITORIES.'
AND
SAID
HE,
'MR.
KURTZ'S
KNOWLEDGE
OF
UNEXPLORED
REGIONS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
NECESSARILY
EXTENSIVE
AND
PE-
CULIAR
--
OWING
TO
HIS
GREAT
ABILITIES
AND
TO
THE
DEPLOR-
ABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES
IN
WHICH
HE
HAD
BEEN
PLACED:
THEREFORE
--'
I
ASSURED
HIM
MR.
KURTZ'S
KNOWLEDGE,
HOWEVER
EXTENSIVE,
DID
NOT
BEAR
UPON
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
COMMERCE
OR
ADMINISTRATION.
HE
INVOKED
THEN
THE
NAME
OF
SCIENCE.
'IT
WOULD
BE
AN
INCALCULABLE
LOSS
IF,'
ETC.,
ETC.
I
OFFERED
HIM
THE
REPORT
ON
THE
'SUPPRESSION
OF
SAVAGE
CUSTOMS,'
WITH
THE
POSTSCRIPTUM
TORN
OFF.
HE
TOOK
IT
UP
EAGERLY,
BUT
ENDED
BY
SNIFFING
AT
IT
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
CONTEMPT.
'THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
WE
HAD
A
RIGHT
TO
EXPECT,'
HE
REMARKED.
'EXPECT
NOTHING
ELSE,'
I
SAID.
'THERE
ARE
ONLY
PRIVATE
LETTERS.'
HE
WITHDREW
UPON
SOME
THREAT
OF
LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS,
AND
I
SAW
HIM
NO
MORE;
BUT
ANOTHER
FELLOW,
CALLING
HIMSELF
KURTZ'S
COUSIN,
APPEARED
TWO
DAYS
LATER,
AND
WAS
ANXIOUS
TO
HEAR
ALL
THE
DETAILS
ABOUT
HIS
DEAR
RELATIVE'S
LAST
MO-
MENTS.
INCIDENTALLY
HE
GAVE
ME
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
KURTZ
HAD
BEEN
ESSENTIALLY
A
GREAT
MUSICIAN.
'THERE
WAS
THE
MAKING
OF
AN
IMMENSE
SUCCESS,'
SAID
THE
MAN,
WHO
WAS
AN
ORGANIST,
I
BELIEVE,
WITH
LANK
GREY
HAIR
FLOWING
OVER
A
GREASY
COAT-COLLAR.
I
HAD
NO
REASON
TO
DOUBT
HIS
STATEMENT,
AND
TO
THIS
DAY
I
AM
UNABLE
TO
SAY
WHAT
WAS
KURTZ'S
PROFESSION,
WHETHER
HE
EVER
HAD
ANY
--
WHICH
WAS
THE
GREATEST
OF
HIS
TALENTS.
I
HAD
TAKEN
HIM
FOR
A
PAINTER
WHO
WROTE
FOR
THE
PAPERS,
OR
ELSE
FOR
A
JOURNALIST
WHO
COULD
PAINT
--
BUT
EVEN
THE
COUSIN
(WHO
TOOK
SNUFF
DURING
THE
INTERVIEW)
COULD
NOT
TELL
ME
WHAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
--
EXACTLY.
HE
WAS
A
UNIVERSAL
GENIUS
--
ON
THAT
POINT
I
AGREED
WITH
THE
OLD
CHAP,
WHO
THEREUPON
BLEW
HIS
NOSE
NOISILY
INTO
A
LARGE
COTTON
HANDKERCHIEF
AND
WITHDREW
IN
SENILE
AGITATION,
BEAR-
ING
OFF
SOME
FAMILY
LETTERS
AND
MEMORANDA
WITHOUT
IMPORTANCE.
ULTIMATELY
A
JOURNALIST
ANXIOUS
TO
KNOW
SOMETHING
OF
THE
FATE
OF
HIS
'DEAR
COLLEAGUE'
TURNED
UP.
THIS
VISITOR
INFORMED
ME
KURTZ'S
PROPER
SPHERE
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
POLITICS
'ON
THE
POPULAR
SIDE.'
HE
HAD
FURRY
STRAIGHT
EYEBROWS,
BRISTLY
HAIR
CROPPED
SHORT,
AN
EYEGLASS
ON
A
BROAD
RIBBON,
AND,
BECOMING
EXPANSIVE,
CONFESSED
HIS
OPINION
THAT
KURTZ
REALLY
COULDN'T
WRITE
A
BIT
--
'BUT
HEAVENS!
HOW
THAT
MAN
COULD
TALK.
HE
ELECTRIFIED
LARGE
MEETINGS.
HE
HAD
FAITH
--
DON'T
YOU
SEE?
--
HE
HAD
THE
FAITH.
HE
COULD
GET
HIMSELF
TO
BELIEVE
ANYTHING
--
ANYTHING.
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
SPLENDID
LEADER
OF
AN
EXTREME
PARTY.'
'WHAT
PARTY?'
I
ASKED.
'ANY
PARTY,'
ANSWERED
THE
OTHER.
'HE
WAS
AN
--
AN
--
EXTREMIST.'
DID
I
NOT
THINK
SO?
I
ASSENTED.
DID
I
KNOW,
HE
ASKED,
WITH
A
SUDDEN
FLASH
OF
CURIOSITY,
'WHAT
IT
WAS
THAT
HAD
INDUCED
HIM
TO
GO
OUT
THERE?'
'YES,'
SAID
I,
AND
FORTHWITH
HANDED
HIM
THE
FAMOUS
REPORT
FOR
PUBLICATION,
IF
HE
THOUGHT
FIT.
HE
GLANCED
THROUGH
IT
HURRIEDLY,
MUMBLING
ALL
THE
TIME,
JUDGED
'IT
WOULD
DO,'
AND
TOOK
HIMSELF
OFF
WITH
THIS
PLUNDER.


"THUS
I
WAS
LEFT
AT
LAST
WITH
A
SLIM
PACKET
OF
LET-
TERS
AND
THE
GIRL'S
PORTRAIT.
SHE
STRUCK
ME
AS
BEAUTIFUL
--
I
MEAN
SHE
HAD
A
BEAUTIFUL
EXPRESSION.
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
SUNLIGHT
CAN
BE
MADE
TO
LIE,
TOO,
YET
ONE
FELT
THAT
NO
MANIPULATION
OF
LIGHT
AND
POSE
COULD
HAVE
CON-
VEYED
THE
DELICATE
SHADE
OF
TRUTHFULNESS
UPON
THOSE
FEATURES.
SHE
SEEMED
READY
TO
LISTEN
WITHOUT
MENTAL
RESERVATION,
WITHOUT
SUSPICION,
WITHOUT
A
THOUGHT
FOR
HERSELF.
I
CONCLUCLED
I
WOULD
GO
AND
GIVE
HER
BACK
HER
PORTRAIT
AND
THOSE
LETTERS
MYSELF.
CURIOSITY?
YES;
AND
ALSO
SOME
OTHER
FEELING
PERHAPS.
ALL
THAT
HAD
BEEN
KURTZ'S
HAD
PASSED
OUT
OF
MY
HANDS:
HIS
SOUL,
HIS
BODY,
HIS
STATION,
HIS
PLANS,
HIS
IVORY,
HIS
CAREER.
THERE
REMAINED
ONLY
HIS
MEMORY
AND
HIS
INTENDED
--
AND
I
WANTED
TO
GIVE
THAT
UP,
TOO,
TO
THE
PAST,
IN
A
WAY
--
TO
SURRENDER
PERSONALLY
ALL
THAT
REMAINED
OF
HIM
WITH
ME
TO
THAT
OBLIVION
WHICH
IS
THE
LAST
WORD
OF
OUR
COMMON
FATE.
I
DON'T
DEFEND
MYSELF.
I
HAD
NO
CLEAR
PERCEPTION
OF
WHAT
IT
WAS
I
REALLY
WANTED.
PERHAPS
IT
WAS
AN
IMPULSE
OF
UNCONSCIOUS
LOYALTY,
OR
THE
FULFIL-
MENT
OF
ONE
OF
THOSE
IRONIC
NECESSITIES
THAT
LURK
IN
THE
FACTS
OF
HUMAN
EXISTENCE.
I
DON'T
KNOW.
I
CAN'T
TELL.
BUT
I
WENT.


"I
THOUGHT
HIS
MEMORY
WAS
LIKE
THE
OTHER
MEMO-
RIES
OF
THE
DEAD
THAT
ACCUMULATE
IN
EVERY
MAN'S
LIFE
--
A
VAGUE
IMPRESS
ON
THE
BRAIN
OF
SHADOWS
THAT
HAD
FALLEN
ON
IT
IN
THEIR
SWIFT
AND
FINAL
PASSAGE;
BUT
BEFORE
THE
HIGH
AND
PONDEROUS
DOOR,
BETWEEN
THE
TALL
HOUSES
OF
A
STREET
AS
STILL
AND
DECOROUS
AS
A
WELL-KEPT
ALLEY
IN
A
CEMETERY,
I
HAD
A
VISION
OF
HIM
ON
THE
STRETCHER,
OPENING
HIS
MOUTH
VORACIOUSLY,
AS
IF
TO
DEVOUR
ALL
THE
EARTH
WITH
ALL
ITS
MANKIND.
HE
LIVED
THEN
BEFORE
ME;
HE
LIVED
AS
MUCH
AS
HE
HAD
EVER
LIVED
--
A
SHADOW
IN-
SATIABLE
OF
SPLENDID
APPEARANCES,
OF
FRIGHTFUL
REALITIES;
A
SHADOW
DARKER
THAN
THE
SHADOW
OF
THE
NIGHT,
AND
DRAPED
NOBLY
IN
THE
FOLDS
OF
A
GORGEOUS
ELOQUENCE.
THE
VISION
SEEMED
TO
ENTER
THE
HOUSE
WITH
ME
--
THE
STRETCHER,
THE
PHANTOM-BEARERS,
THE
WILD
CROWD
OF
OBEDIENT
WORSHIPPERS,
THE
GLOOM
OF
THE
FORESTS,
THE
GLITTER
OF
THE
REACH
BETWEEN
THE
MURKY
BENDS,
THE
BEAT
OF
THE
DRUM,
REGULAR
AND
MUFFLED
LIKE
THE
BEATING
OF
A
HEART
--
THE
HEART
OF
A
CONQUERING
DARKNESS.
IT
WAS
A
MOMENT
OF
TRIUMPH
FOR
THE
WILDERNESS,
AN
INVADING
AND
VENGEFUL
RUSH
WHICH,
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME,
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
KEEP
BACK
ALONE
FOR
THE
SALVATION
OF
ANOTHER
SOUL.
AND
THE
MEMORY
OF
WHAT
I
HAD
HEARD
HIM
SAY
AFAR
THERE,
WITH
THE
HORNED
SHAPES
STIRRING
AT
MY
BACK,
IN
THE
GLOW
OF
FIRES,
WITHIN
THE
PATIENT
WOODS,
THOSE
BROKEN
PHRASES
CAME
BACK
TO
ME,
WERE
HEARD
AGAIN
IN
THEIR
OMINOUS
AND
TERRIFYING
SIMPLICITY.
I
REMEM-
BERED
HIS
ABJECT
PLEADING,
HIS
ABJECT
THREATS,
THE
COLOS-
SAL
SCALE
OF
HIS
VILE
DESIRES,
THE
MEANNESS,
THE
TORMENT,
THE
TEMPESTUOUS
ANGUISH
OF
HIS
SOUL.
AND
LATER
ON
I
SEEMED
TO
SEE
HIS
COLLECTED
LANGUID
MANNER,
WHEN
HE
SAID
ONE
DAY,
'THIS
LOT
OF
IVORY
NOW
IS
REALLY
MINE.
THE
COMPANY
DID
NOT
PAY
FOR
IT.
I
COLLECTED
IT
MYSELF
AT
A
VERY
GREAT
PERSONAL
RISK.
I
AM
AFRAID
THEY
WILL
TRY
TO
CLAIM
IT
AS
THEIRS
THOUGH.
H'M.
IT
IS
A
DIFFICULT
CASE.
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
I
OUGHT
TO
DO
--
RESIST?
EH?
I
WANT
NO
MORE
THAN
JUSTICE.'
.
.
.
HE
WANTED
NO
MORE
THAN
JUSTICE
--
NO
MORE
THAN
JUSTICE.
I
RANG
THE
BELL
BEFORE
A
MAHOGANY
DOOR
ON
THE
FIRST
FLOOR,
AND
WHILE
I
WAITED
HE
SEEMED
TO
STARE
AT
ME
OUT
OF
THE
GLASSY
PANEL
--
STARE
WITH
THAT
WIDE
AND
IMMENSE
STARE
EMBRACING,
CON-
DEMNING,
LOATHING
ALL
THE
UNIVERSE.
I
SEEMED
TO
HEAR
THE
WHISPERED
CRY,
'THE
HORROR!
THE
HORROR!
'


"THE
DUSK
WAS
FALLING.
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
IN
A
LOFTY
DRAWINGROOM
WITH
THREE
LONG
WINDOWS
FROM
FLOOR
TO
CEILING
THAT
WERE
LIKE
THREE
LUMINOUS
AND
BEDRAPED
COLUMNS.
THE
BENT
GILT
LEGS
AND
BACKS
OF
THE
FURNITURE
SHONE
IN
INDISTINCT
CURVES.
THE
TALL
MARBLE
FIREPLACE
HAD
A
COLD
AND
MONUMENTAL
WHITENESS.
A
GRAND
PIANO
STOOD
MASSIVELY
IN
A
CORNER;
WITH
DARK
GLEAMS
ON
THE
FLAT
SURFACES
LIKE
A
SOMBRE
AND
POLISHED
SARCOPHAGUS.
A
HIGH
DOOR
OPENED
CLOSED
I
ROSE.


"SHE
CAME
FORWARD,
ALL
IN
BLACK,
WITH
A
PALE
HEAD,
FLOATING
TOWARDS
ME
IN
THE
DUSK.
SHE
WAS
IN
MOURNING.
IT
WAS
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
SINCE
HIS
DEATH,
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
SINCE
THE
NEWS
CAME;
SHE
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
SHE
WOULD
REMEMBER
AND
MOURN
FOREVER.
SHE
TOOK
BOTH
MY
HANDS
IN
HERS
AND
MURMURED,
'I
HAD
HEARD
YOU
WERE
COMING.'
I
NOTICED
SHE
WAS
NOT
VERY
YOUNG
--
I
MEAN
NOT
GIRLISH.
SHE
HAD
A
MATURE
CAPACITY
FOR
FIDEL-
ITY,
FOR
BELIEF,
FOR
SUFFERING.
THE
ROOM
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
GROWN
DARKER,
AS
IF
ALL
THE
SAD
LIGHT
OF
THE
CLOUDY
EVE-
NING
HAD
TAKEN
REFUGE
ON
HER
FOREHEAD.
THIS
FAIR
HAIR,
THIS
PALE
VISAGE,
THIS
PURE
BROW,
SEEMED
SURROUNDED
BY
AN
ASHY
HALO
FROM
WHICH
THE
DARK
EYES
LOOKED
OUT
AT
ME.
THEIR
GLANCE
WAS
GUILELESS,
PROFOUND,
CONFI-
DENT,
AND
TRUSTFUL.
SHE
CARRIED
HER
SORROWFUL
HEAD
AS
THOUGH
SHE
WERE
PROUD
OF
THAT
SORROW,
AS
THOUGH
SHE
WOULD
SAY,
'I
--
I
ALONE
KNOW
HOW
TO
MOURN
FOR
HIM
AS
HE
DESERVES.'
BUT
WHILE
WE
WERE
STILL
SHAKING
HANDS,
SUCH
A
LOOK
OF
AWFUL
DESOLATION
CAME
UPON
HER
FACE
THAT
I
PERCEIVED
SHE
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
CREATURES
THAT
ARE
NOT
THE
PLAYTHINGS
OF
TIME.
FOR
HER
HE
HAD
DIED
ONLY
YESTERDAY.
AND,
BY
JOVE!
THE
IMPRESSION
WAS
SO
POWERFUL
THAT
FOR
ME,
TOO,
HE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
DIED
ONLY
YESTERDAY
--
NAY,
THIS
VERY
MINUTE.
I
SAW
HER
AND
HIM
IN
THE
SAME
INSTANT
OF
TIME
--
HIS
DEATH
AND
HER
SORROW
--
I
SAW
HER
SORROW
IN
THE
VERY
MOMENT
OF
HIS
DEATH.
DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND?
I
SAW
THEM
TOGETHER
-
I
HEARD
THEM
TOGETHER.
SHE
HAD
SAID,
WITH
A
DEEP
CATCH
OF
THE
BREATH,
'I
HAVE
SURVIVED'
WHILE
MY
STRAINED
EARS
SEEMED
TO
HEAR
DISTINCTLY,
MINGLED
WITH
HER
TONE
OF
DESPAIRING
REGRET,
THE
SUMMING
UP
WHISPER
OF
HIS
ETERNAL
CONDEMNATION.
I
ASKED
MYSELF
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
THERE,
WITH
A
SENSATION
OF
PANIC
IN
MY
HEART
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
BLUNDERED
INTO
A
PLACE
OF
CRUEL
AND
ABSURD
MYSTERIES
NOT
FIT
FOR
A
HUMAN
BEING
TO
BEHOLD.
SHE
MOTIONED
ME
TO
A
CHAIR.
WE
SAT
DOWN.
I
LAID
THE
PACKET
GENTLY
ON
THE
LITTLE
TABLE,
AND
SHE
PUT
HER
HAND
OVER
IT....
'YOU
KNEW
HIM
WELL,'
SHE
MURMURED,
AFTER
A
MOMENT
OF
MOURNING
SILENCE.


"
'INTIMACY
GROWS
QUICKLY
OUT
THERE,'
I
SAID.
'I
KNEW
HIM
AS
WELL
AS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
ONE
MAN
TO
KNOW
ANOTHER.'


"
'AND
YOU
ADMIRED
HIM,'
SHE
SAID.
'IT
WAS
IMPOS-
SIBLE
TO
KNOW
HIM
AND
NOT
TO
ADMIRE
HIM.
WAS
IT?'


"
'HE
WAS
A
REMARKABLE
MAN,'
I
SAID,
UNSTEADILY.
THEN
BEFORE
THE
APPEALING
FIXITY
OF
HER
GAZE,
THAT
SEEMED
TO
WATCH
FOR
MORE
WORDS
ON
MY
LIPS,
I
WENT
ON,
'IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
NOT
TO
--'


"
'LOVE
HIM,'
SHE
FINISHED
EAGERLY,
SILENCING
ME
INTO
AN
APPALLED
DUMBNESS.
'HOW
TRUE!
HOW
TRUEL
BUT
WHEN
YOU
THINK
THAT
NO
ONE
KNEW
HIM
SO
WELL
AS
I!
I
HAD
ALL
HIS
NOBLE
CONFIDENCE.
I
KNEW
HIM
BEST.'


"
'YOU
KNEW
HIM
BEST,'
I
REPEATED.
AND
PERHAPS
SHE
DID.
BUT
WITH
EVERY
WORD
SPOKEN
THE
ROOM
WAS
GROWING
DARKER,
AND
ONLY
HER
FOREHEAD,
SMOOTH
AND
WHITE,
REMAINED
ILLUMINED
BY
THE
UNEXTINGUISHABLE
LIGHT
OF
BELIEF
AND
LOVE.


"
'YOU
WERE
HIS
FRIEND,'
SHE
WENT
ON.
'HIS
FRIEND,'
SHE
REPEATED,
A
LITTLE
LOUDER.
'YOU
MUST
HAVE
BEEN,
IF
HE
HAD
GIVEN
YOU
THIS,
AND
SENT
YOU
TO
ME.
I
FEEL
I
CAN
SPEAK
TO
YOU
--
AND
OH!
I
MUST
SPEAK.
I
WANT
YOU
--
YOU
WHO
HAVE
HEARD
HIS
LAST
WORDS
--
TO
KNOW
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORTHY
OF
HIM....
IT
IS
NOT
PRIDE....
YES!
I
AM
PROUD
TO
KNOW
I
UNDERSTOOD
HIM
BETTER
THAN
ANY
ONE
ON
EARTH
--
HE
TOLD
ME
SO
HIMSELF.
AND
SINCE
HIS
MOTHER
DIED
I
HAVE
HAD
NO
ONE
--
NO
ONE
--
TO
--
TO
--'


"I
LISTENED.
THE
DARKNESS
DEEPENED.
I
WAS
NOT
EVEN
SURE
WHETHER
HE
HAD
GIVEN
ME
THE
RIGHT
BUNDLE.
I
RATHER
SUSPECT
HE
WANTED
ME
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
ANOTHER
BATCH
OF
HIS
PAPERS
WHICH,
AFTER
HIS
DEATH,
I
SAW
THE
MANAGER
EXAMINING
UNDER
THE
LAMP.
AND
THE
GIRL
TALKED,
EASING
HER
PAIN
IN
THE
CERTITUDE
OF
MY
SYMPA-
THY;
SHE
TALKED
AS
THIRSTY
MEN
DRINK.
I
HAD
HEARD
THAT
HER
ENGAGEMENT
WITH
KURTZ
HAD
BEEN
DISAPPROVED
BY
HER
PEOPLE.
HE
WASN'T
RICH
ENOUGH
OR
SOMETHING.
AND
INDEED
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHETHER
HE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
A
PAU-
PER
ALL
HIS
LIFE.
HE
HAD
GIVEN
ME
SOME
REASON
TO
INFER
THAT
IT
WAS
HIS
IMPATIENCE
OF
COMPARATIVE
POVERTY
THAT
DROVE
HIM
OUT
THERE.


"
'.
.
.
WHO
WAS
NOT
HIS
FRIEND
WHO
HAD
HEARD
HIM
SPEAK
ONCE?'
SHE
WAS
SAYING.
'HE
DREW
MEN
TOWARDS
HIM
BY
WHAT
WAS
BEST
IN
THEM.'
SHE
LOOKED
AT
ME
WITH
INTENSITY.
'IT
IS
THE
GIFT
OF
THE
GREAT,'
SHE
WENT
ON,
AND
THE
SOUND
OF
HER
LOW
VOICE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
THE
AC-
COMPANIMENT
OF
ALL
THE
OTHER
SOUNDS,
FULL
OF
MYSTERY,
DESOLATION,
AND
SORROW,
I
HAD
EVER
HEARD
--
THE
RIPPLE
OF
THE
RIVER,
THE
SOUGHING
OF
THE
TREES
SWAYED
BY
THE
WIND,
THE
MURMURS
OF
THE
CROWDS,
THE
FAINT
RING
OF
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
WORDS
CRIED
FROM
AFAR,
THE
WHISPER
OF
A
VOICE
SPEAKING
FROM
BEYOND
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
AN
ETERNAL
DARKNESS.
'BUT
YOU
HAVE
HEARD
HIM!
YOU
KNOW!'
SHE
CRIED.


"
'YES,
I
KNOW,'
I
SAID
WITH
SOMETHING
LIKE
DESPAIR
IN
MY
HEART,
BUT
BOWING
MY
HEAD
BEFORE
THE
FAITH
THAT
WAS
IN
HER,
BEFORE
THAT
GREAT
AND
SAVING
ILLUSION
THAT
SHONE
WITH
AN
UNEARTHLY
GLOW
IN
THE
DARKNESS,
IN
THE
TRIUMPHANT
DARKNESS
FROM
WHICH
I
COULD
NOT
HAVE
DEFENDED
HER
--
FROM
WHICH
I
COULD
NOT
EVEN
DEFEND
MYSELF.


"
'WHAT
A
LOSS
TO
ME
--
TO
US!'
--
SHE
CORRECTED
HER-
SELF
WITH
BEAUTIFUL
GENEROSITY;
THEN
ADDED
IN
A
MUR-
MUR,
'TO
THE
WORLD.'
BY
THE
LAST
GLEAMS
OF
TWILIGHT
I
COULD
SEE
THE
GLITTER
OF
HER
EYES,
FULL
OF
TEARS
--
OF
TEARS
THAT
WOULD
NOT
FALL.


"
'I
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
HAPPY
--
VERY
FORTUNATE
--
VERY
PROUD,'
SHE
WENT
ON.
'TOO
FORTUNATE.
TOO
HAPPY
FOR
A
LITTLE
WHILE.
AND
NOW
I
AM
UNHAPPY
FOR
--
FOR
LIFE.'


"SHE
STOOD
UP;
HER
FAIR
HAIR
SEEMED
TO
CATCH
ALL
THE
REMAINING
LIGHT
IN
A
GLIMMER
OF
GOLD.
I
ROSE,
TOO.


"
'AND
OF
ALL
THIS,'
SHE
WENT
ON
MOURNFULLY,
'OF
ALL
HIS
PROMISE,
AND
OF
ALL
HIS
GREATNESS,
OF
HIS
GENEROUS
MIND,
OF
HIS
NOBLE
HEART,
NOTHING
REMAINS
--
NOTHING
BUT
A
MEMORY.
YOU
AND
I
--'


"
'WE
SHALL
ALWAYS
REMEMBER
HIM,'
I
SAID
HASTILY.


"
'NO!'
SHE
CRIED.
'IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
THAT
ALL
THIS
SHOULD
BE
LOST
--
THAT
SUCH
A
LIFE
SHOULD
BE
SACRIFICED
TO
LEAVE
NOTHING
--
BUT
SORROW.
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
VAST
PLANS
HE
HAD.
I
KNEW
OF
THEM,
TOO
--
I
COULD
NOT
PERHAPS
UNDERSTAND
--
BUT
OTHERS
KNEW
OF
THEM.
SOMETHING
MUST
REMAIN.
HIS
WORDS,
AT
LEAST,
HAVE
NOT
DIED.'


"
'HIS
WORDS
WILL
REMAIN,'
I
SAID.


"
'AND
HIS
EXAMPLE,'
SHE
WHISPERED
TO
HERSELF.
'MEN
LOOKED
UP
TO
HIM
--
HIS
GOODNESS
SHONE
IN
EVERY
ACT.
HIS
EXAMPLE
--'


"
'TRUE,'
I
SAID;
'HIS
EXAMPLE,
TOO.
YES,
HIS
EXAMPLE.
I
FORGOT
THAT.'


"
'BUT
I
DO
NOT.
I
CANNOT
--
I
CANNOT
BELIEVE
--
NOT
YET.
I
CANNOT
BELIEVE
THAT
I
SHALL
NEVER
SEE
HIM
AGAIN,
THAT
NOBODY
WILL
SEE
HIM
AGAIN,
NEVER,
NEVER,
NEVER.'


"SHE
PUT
OUT
HER
ARMS
AS
IF
AFTER
A
RETREATING
FIGURE,
STRETCHING
THEM
BACK
AND
WITH
CLASPED
PALE
HANDS
ACROSS
THE
FADING
AND
NARROW
SHEEN
OF
THE
WINDOW.
NEVER
SEE
HIM!
I
SAW
HIM
CLEARLY
ENOUGH
THEN.
I
SHALL
SEE
THIS
ELOQUENT
PHANTOM
AS
LONG
AS
I
LIVE,
AND
I
SHALL
SEE
HER,
TOO,
A
TRAGIC
AND
FAMILIAR
SHADE,
RESEMBLING
IN
THIS
GESTURE
ANOTHER
ONE,
TRAGIC
ALSO,
AND
BEDECKED
WITH
POWERLESS
CHARMS,
STRETCHING
BARE
BROWN
ARMS
OVER
THE
GLITTER
OF
THE
INFERNAL
STREAM,
THE
STREAM
OF
DARKNESS.
SHE
SAID
SUDDENLY
VERY
LOW,
'HE
DIED
AS
HE
LIVED.'


"
'HIS
END,'
SAID
I,
WITH
DULL
ANGER
STIRRING
IN
ME,
'WAS
IN
EVERY
WAY
WORTHY
OF
HIS
LIFE.'


"
'AND
I
WAS
NOT
WITH
HIM,'
SHE
MURMURED.
MY
ANGER
SUBSIDED
BEFORE
A
FEELING
OF
INFINITE
PITY.


"
'EVERYTHING
THAT
COULD
BE
DONE
--'
I
MUMBLED.


"
'AH,
BUT
I
BELIEVED
IN
HIM
MORE
THAN
ANY
ONE
ON
EARTH
--
MORE
THAN
HIS
OWN
MOTHER,
MORE
THAN
--
HIM-
SELF.
HE
NEEDED
ME!
ME!
I
WOULD
HAVE
TREASURED
EVERY
SIGH,
EVERY
WORD,
EVERY
SIGN,
EVERY
GLANCE.'


"I
FELT
LIKE
A
CHILL
GRIP
ON
MY
CHEST.
'DON'T,'
I
SAID,
IN
A
MUFFLED
VOICE.


"
'FORGIVE
ME.
I
--
I
HAVE
MOURNED
SO
LONG
IN
SILENCE
--
IN
SILENCE....
YOU
WERE
WITH
HIM
--
TO
THE
LAST?
I
THINK
OF
HIS
LONELINESS.
NOBODY
NEAR
TO
UNDER-
STAND
HIM
AS
I
WOULD
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD.
PERHAPS
NO
ONE
TO
HEAR....'


"
'TO
THE
VERY
END,'
I
SAID,
SHAKILY.
'I
HEARD
HIS
VERY
LAST
WORDS....'
I
STOPPED
IN
A
FRIGHT.


"
'REPEAT
THEM,'
SHE
MURMURED
IN
A
HEART-BROKEN
TONE.
'I
WANT
--
I
WANT
--
SOMETHING
--
SOMETHING
--
TO
--
TO
LIVE
WITH.'


"I
WAS
ON
THE
POINT
OF
CRYING
AT
HER,
'DON'T
YOU
HEAR
THEM?'
THE
DUSK
WAS
REPEATING
THEM
IN
A
PER-
SISTENT
WHISPER
ALL
AROUND
US,
IN
A
WHISPER
THAT
SEEMED
TO
SWELL
MENACINGLY
LIKE
THE
FIRST
WHISPER
OF
A
RISING
WIND.
'THE
HORROR!
THE
HORROR!'


"
'HIS
LAST
WORD
--
TO
LIVE
WITH,'
SHE
INSISTED.
'DON'T
YOU
UNDERSTAND
I
LOVED
HIM
--
I
LOVED
HIM
--
I
LOVED
HIM!'


"I
PULLED
MYSELF
TOGETHER
AND
SPOKE
SLOWLY.


"'THE
LAST
WORD
HE
PRONOUNCED
WAS
--
YOUR
NAME.'


"I
HEARD
A
LIGHT
SIGH
AND
THEN
MY
HEART
STOOD
STILL,
STOPPED
DEAD
SHORT
BY
AN
EXULTING
AND
TERRIBLE
CRY,
BY
THE
CRY
OF
INCONCEIVABLE
TRIUMPH
AND
OF
UNSPEAKABLE
PAIN.
'I
KNEW
IT
--
I
WAS
SURE!'
.
.
.
SHE
KNEW.
SHE
WAS
SURE.
I
HEARD
HER
WEEPING;
SHE
HAD
HIDDEN
HER
FACE
IN
HER
HANDS.
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
THE
HOUSE
WOULD
COLLAPSE
BEFORE
I
COULD
ESCAPE,
THAT
THE
HEAVENS
WOULD
FALL
UPON
MY
HEAD.
BUT
NOTHING
HAPPENED.
THE
HEAVENS
DO
NOT
FALL
FOR
SUCH
A
TRIFLE.
WOULD
THEY
HAVE
FALLEN,
I
WONDER,
IF
I
HAD
RENDERED
KURTZ
THAT
JUSTICE
WHICH
WAS
HIS
DUE?
HADN'T
HE
SAID
HE
WANTED
ONLY
JUSTICE?
BUT
I
COULDN'T.
I
COULD
NOT
TELL
HER.
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TOO
DARK
--
TOO
DARK
ALTOGETHER...."


MARLOW
CEASED,
AND
SAT
APART,
INDISTINCT
AND
SILENT,
IN
THE
POSE
OF
A
MEDITATING
BUDDHA.
NOBODY
MOVED
FOR
A
TIME.
"WE
HAVE
LOST
THE
FIRST
OF
THE
EBB,"
SAID
THE
DIRECTOR
SUDDENLY.
I
RAISED
MY
HEAD.
THE
OFFING
WAS
BARRED
BY
A
BLACK
BANK
OF
CLOUDS,
AND
THE
TRAN-
QUIL
WATERWAY
LEADING
TO
THE
UTTERMOST
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH
FLOWED
SOMBRE
UNDER
AN
OVERCAST
SKY
--
SEEMED
TO
LEAD
INTO
THE
HEART
OF
AN
IMMENSE
DARKNESS.
